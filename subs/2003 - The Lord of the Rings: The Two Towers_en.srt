1
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,200
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!

2
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,000
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,800
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

5
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,840
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,520
No! No!

7
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,600
Gandalf!

8
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,520
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,920
No!

10
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Gandalf!

11
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
Gandalf!

12
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,520
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,040
Nothing.

14
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Just a dream.

15
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,560
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

16
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,840
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

17
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
It's just where we can't get.

18
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,480
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

19
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
I don't think Gandalf meant for us
to come this way.

20
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,080
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

21
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
...but they did.

22
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Mr. Frodo?

23
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
It's the Ring, isn't it?

24
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
It's getting heavier.

25
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,120
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

26
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Oh, yes. Lovely.

27
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,600
Lembas bread. And look!

28
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,120
More lembas bread.

29
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,320
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

30
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,360
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

31
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,560
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

32
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,360
Those rain clouds might.

33
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,800
This looks strangely familiar.

34
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,800
It's because we've been here before.

35
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,400
We're going in circles.

36
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,920
What is that horrid stink?

37
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

38
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,200
- Can you smell it?
Yes.

39
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,280
I can smell it.

40
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,760
We're not alone.

41
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,800
The thieves. The thieves.

42
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,760
The filthy little thieves.

43
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,240
Where is it?

44
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,960
They stole it from us.

45
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,160
My precious.

46
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,120
Curse them, we hates them!

47
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,240
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

48
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,720
This is Sting.

49
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,400
You've seen it before...

50
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
...haven't you, Gollum?

51
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

52
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,280
It burns!

53
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,680
It burns us!

54
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,480
It freezes!

55
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Nasty Elves twisted it.

56
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

57
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,480
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

58
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

59
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
That would kill us! Kill us!

60
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,480
It's no more than you deserve!

61
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Maybe he does deserve to die.

62
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,680
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

63
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,680
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

64
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,560
Take it off us.

65
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,320
We swears to do what you wants.

66
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
We swears.

67
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,960
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

68
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,200
We swears...

69
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,960
...to serve the master of the precious.

70
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,760
We will swear on...

71
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,840
...on the precious.

72
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Gollum. Gollum.

73
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,240
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

74
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
Yes...

75
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,240
...on the precious.

76
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,840
On the precious.

77
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't believe you!

78
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

79
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
He's trying to trick us.

80
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,640
If we let him go,
he'll throttle us in our sleep.

81
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,920
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

82
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,400
You've been there before?

83
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
Yes.

84
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,840
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

85
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,680
Merry!

86
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,400
What is it? What do you smell?

87
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,960
Man-flesh.

88
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,840
Aragorn.

89
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,840
They've picked up our trail.

90
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
Let's move!

91
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,160
Their pace has quickened.

92
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,000
They must have caught our scent.

93
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,880
Hurry!

94
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,040
Come on, Gimli!

95
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,920
Three days and nights pursuit.

96
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,920
No food. No rest.

97
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,920
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

98
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,120
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

99
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,680
They may yet be alive.

100
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,000
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

101
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,920
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

102
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,200
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

103
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
Very dangerous over short distances.

104
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,760
Rohan.

105
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,600
Home of the Horse-lords.

106
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,200
There's something strange at work here.

107
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,200
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

108
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,240
Sets its will against us.

109
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,000
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

110
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,640
The Uruks turn northeast.

111
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,520
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

112
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,560
Saruman.

113
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,680
The world is changing.

114
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,240
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

115
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,520
...and Mordor?

116
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,520
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...

117
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,160
...and the union of the two towers?

118
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,280
Together, my Lord Sauron...

119
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,800
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.

120
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,320
The Old World will
burn in the fires of industry.

121
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,000
The forests will fall.

122
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,560
A new order will rise.

123
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,280
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

124
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,240
...and the iron fists of the Orc.

125
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,240
We have only to remove
those who oppose us.

126
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,200
The Horse-Men took your lands.

127
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,680
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

128
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,240
Murderers!

129
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,160
Take back the lands they stole from you.

130
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,040
Burn every village!

131
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,040
It will begin in Rohan.

132
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,160
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

133
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,040
But no more.

134
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,360
Éothain! Éothain!

135
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

136
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,920
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

137
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,680
He is too big for him.

138
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,720
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

139
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,320
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

140
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,360
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

141
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,120
Freda, I will find you there.

142
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,440
Quickly!

143
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,080
Go, child.

144
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,440
Rohan, my lord...

145
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,400
...is ready to fall.

146
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,520
Théodred.

147
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,680
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

148
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
He was ambushed by Orcs.

149
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,360
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

150
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,120
That is a lie.

151
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,920
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

152
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,440
Gríma.

153
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,520
Gríma.

154
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,200
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

155
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,040
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

156
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,480
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

157
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,520
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

158
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,080
Can you not see?

159
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,080
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

160
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,680
...your warmongering.

161
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,680
Warmongering?

162
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,920
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

163
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,000
What was the promised price, Gríma?

164
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,720
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

165
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,240
Too long have you watched my sister.

166
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,320
Too long have you haunted her steps.

167
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,200
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

168
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,480
Too much.

169
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,320
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

170
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,680
...under pain of death.

171
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,920
Keep breathing. That's the key.

172
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,800
Breathe.

173
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

174
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,880
We're not going no further...

175
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,960
...until we've had a breather.

176
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,360
Get a fire going!

177
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,400
Merry!

178
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,000
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

179
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,200
What's making that noise?

180
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,080
It's the trees.

181
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,840
What?

182
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,840
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

183
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,320
Folk used to say there was something
in the water that made the trees grow tall...

184
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,920
...and come alive.

185
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,800
Alive?

186
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
Trees that could whisper...

187
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
...talk to each other...

188
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,520
...even move.

189
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,200
I'm starving.

190
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,280
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

191
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,840
Yeah!

192
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,160
Why can't we have some meat?!

193
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,560
What about them?

194
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,560
They're fresh.

195
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,800
They are not for eating.

196
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,400
What about their legs?

197
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,800
They don't need those.

198
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,280
- They look tasty.
Get back, scum!

199
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,280
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.

200
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
No!

201
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,280
Looks like meat's
back on the menu, boys.

202
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,840
Pippin.

203
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,600
Let's go.

204
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,160
Go on.

205
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,760
Call for help.

206
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,120
Squeal.

207
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,360
No one's going to save you now.

208
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,560
Pippin!

209
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
A red sun rises.

210
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,520
Blood has been spilled this night.

211
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,240
Riders of Rohan...

212
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,000
...what news from the Mark?

213
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,800
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

214
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,800
Speak quickly!

215
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,600
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

216
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,800
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

217
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,520
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

218
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
You would die before your stroke fell.

219
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,640
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

220
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,000
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

221
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,280
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

222
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,520
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

223
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,840
Not even his own kin.

224
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,080
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

225
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,080
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

226
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,840
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

227
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,720
And for that, we are banished.

228
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,840
The White Wizard is cunning.

229
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,800
He walks here and there, they say...

230
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,920
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

231
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,360
And everywhere,
his spies slip past our nets.

232
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,640
We are no spies.

233
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,640
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

234
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,160
They have taken
two of our friends captive.

235
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,280
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

236
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,480
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

237
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,520
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

238
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
We left none alive.

239
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,040
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

240
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,480
Dead?

241
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,000
I am sorry.

242
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,560
Hasufel! Arod!

243
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,760
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

244
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,520
Farewell.

245
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,640
Look for your friends.

246
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,200
But do not trust to hope.

247
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,280
It has forsaken these lands.

248
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,400
We ride north!

249
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,720
It's one of their wee belts.

250
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,880
We failed them.

251
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,440
A Hobbit lay here.

252
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,840
And the other.

253
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,680
They crawled.

254
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,720
Their hands were bound.

255
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,120
Their bonds were cut.

256
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,000
They ran over here.

257
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,640
They were followed.

258
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,360
The belt!

259
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,200
Run!

260
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,040
Tracks lead away from the battle...

261
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,720
...into Fangorn Forest.

262
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,960
Fangorn?

263
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,640
What madness drove them in there?

264
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,560
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

265
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,240
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

266
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Come here!

267
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,920
Trees. Climb a tree.

268
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,560
He's gone.

269
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,360
Merry!

270
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,560
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

271
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,880
Run, Merry!

272
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,440
Little Orcs.

273
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,840
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

274
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
Tree?

275
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,840
I am no tree!

276
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,160
I am an Ent.

277
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,760
A tree-herder.

278
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,800
A shepherd of the forest.

279
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,280
Don't talk to it, Merry.

280
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,160
Don't encourage it!

281
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,400
Treebeard, some call me.

282
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,480
And whose side are you on?

283
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,600
Side?

284
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,560
I am on nobody's side...

285
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,040
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

286
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,240
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

287
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,880
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

288
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,280
Hobbits? Hmm.

289
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,120
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

290
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

291
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,880
They come with fire.

292
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,520
They come with axes.

293
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,320
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

294
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,160
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

295
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,080
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

296
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,000
Halflings!

297
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,240
Shire-folk!

298
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,640
Maybe you are...

299
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,400
...and maybe you aren't.

300
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,200
The White Wizard will know.

301
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,840
The White Wizard?

302
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,760
Saruman.

303
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,400
See? See?

304
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,920
We've led you out.

305
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,520
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

306
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,880
Very lucky we find you.

307
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,960
Nice Hobbit.

308
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,760
Oh!

309
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,880
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

310
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,560
A swamp, yes, yes.

311
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,800
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

312
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,320
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

313
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,960
I found it. I did.

314
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,720
The way through the marshes.

315
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,280
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

316
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,360
They go around for miles and miles.

317
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,920
Come quickly.

318
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,040
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

319
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,160
There are dead things!

320
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,040
Dead faces in the water.

321
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,480
All dead. All rotten.

322
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,560
Elves and Men and Orcses.

323
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,240
A great battle long ago.

324
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,680
Dead Marshes.

325
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,520
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

326
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,800
This way.

327
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,600
Don't follow the lights.

328
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,120
Oh.

329
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,000
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

330
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,120
...and light little candles of their own.

331
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,720
Frodo!

332
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,840
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

333
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,800
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

334
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,760
Are you all right?

335
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,280
So bright.

336
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,120
So beautiful.

337
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,960
Our precious.

338
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,840
What did you say?

339
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,160
Master should be resting.

340
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,200
Master needs to keep up his strength.

341
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,240
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

342
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,840
Gollum. Gollum.

343
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,720
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

344
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

345
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,480
He said your life was a sad story.

346
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,040
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

347
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,080
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

348
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,920
Were you?

349
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,160
Sméagol.

350
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,120
What did you call me?

351
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,040
That was your name once, wasn't it?

352
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,880
A long time ago.

353
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,200
My name.

354
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,240
Sméagol.

355
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,760
Black Riders!

356
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,200
Hide! Hide!

357
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,520
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

358
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,200
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

359
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

360
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,440
No, you cannot kill them. No.

361
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,560
Wraiths!

362
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,880
Wraiths on wings!

363
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,480
They are calling for it.

364
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,080
They are calling for the precious.

365
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,160
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

366
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,560
I'm here.

367
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,400
Hurry, Hobbits.

368
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,680
The Black Gate is very close.

369
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,040
Orc blood.

370
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,360
These are strange tracks.

371
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,520
The air is so close in here.

372
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,960
This forest is old.

373
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,640
Very old.

374
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,520
Full of memory...

375
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,240
...and anger.

376
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,960
The trees are speaking to each other.

377
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,560
Gimli!

378
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,560
Lower your ax.

379
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,760
Oh.

380
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,120
The White Wizard approaches.

381
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,160
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

382
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,520
We must be quick.

383
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,960
You are tracking
the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

384
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,880
Where are they?

385
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,480
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

386
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,720
They met someone they did not expect.

387
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,920
Does that comfort you?

388
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,960
Who are you?

389
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,280
Show yourself!

390
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,720
It cannot be.

391
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,080
You fell.

392
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,920
Through fire...

393
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,320
...and water.

394
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,160
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

395
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,920
...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

396
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,720
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

397
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,160
...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

398
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,400
Darkness took me...

399
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,040
...and I strayed out of thought
and time.

400
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,720
Stars wheeled overhead...

401
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,280
...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

402
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,360
But it was not the end.

403
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,320
I felt life in me again.

404
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,600
I've been sent back...

405
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,240
...until my task is done.

406
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,480
Gandalf.

407
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,040
Gandalf?

408
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,160
Yes.

409
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,560
That was what they used to call me.

410
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,480
Gandalf the Grey.

411
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,440
That was my name.

412
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,000
Gandalf.

413
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I am Gandalf the White.

414
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,720
And I come back to you now...

415
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,280
...at the turn of the tide.

416
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,280
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

417
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,640
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.

418
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,280
That is one of the Mearas...

419
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,120
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

420
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,200
Shadowfax.

421
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,160
He is the lord of all horses...

422
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,480
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

423
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,520
My home lies deep in the forest...

424
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,480
...near the roots of the mountain.

425
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,160
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

426
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,040
And safe is where I'll keep you.

427
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,440
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

428
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,000
Anger festers in their hearts.

429
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,640
They will harm you if they can.

430
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,560
There are too few of us now.

431
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,320
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

432
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,640
The Black Gate of Mordor.

433
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,720
Oh, save us.

434
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,360
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

435
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,800
Master says to
show him the way into Mordor.

436
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,240
So good Sméagol does, master says so.

437
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,600
I did.

438
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,920
That's it, then.

439
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,640
We can't get past that.

440
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,280
Look!

441
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,840
The gate.

442
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,160
It's opening!

443
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,200
I can see a way down.

444
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,920
Sam, no!

445
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,280
Master!

446
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,120
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

447
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,880
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

448
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,040
- Now!
- No!

449
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,520
No! No, master!

450
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,560
They catch you! They catch you!

451
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,240
Don't take it to him.

452
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,680
He wants the precious.

453
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,760
Always he is looking for it.

454
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,640
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

455
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,640
But we mustn't let him have it.

456
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,800
No! There's another way.

457
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,520
More secret. A dark way.

458
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,320
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

459
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,800
He's up to something.

460
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,880
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

461
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,680
Yes. There's a path...

462
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,240
...and some stairs.

463
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,040
And then...

464
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,400
...a tunnel.

465
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,520
He's led us this far, Sam.

466
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,040
Mr. Frodo, no.

467
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,520
He's been true to his word.

468
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,360
No.

469
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,960
Lead the way, Sméagol.

470
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,320
Good Sméagol always helps.

471
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,480
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

472
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,760
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

473
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,200
...whose mind is overthrown.

474
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,480
Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

475
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,120
My lord, your son...

476
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,400
...he is dead.

477
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,560
My lord?

478
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,880
Uncle?

479
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,600
Will you not go to him?

480
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,880
Will you do nothing?

481
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,960
Be careful what you say.

482
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,200
Do not look for welcome here.

483
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

484
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,560
What a tragedy for the king...

485
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,600
...to lose his only son and heir.

486
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,000
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

487
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,840
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

488
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,440
Leave me alone, snake!

489
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,400
Oh, but you are alone.

490
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,560
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

491
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,000
...in the bitter watches of the night...

492
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,720
...when all your life seems to shrink.

493
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,920
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

494
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,440
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

495
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,400
So fair.

496
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,960
So cold.

497
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,800
Like a morning of pale spring...

498
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,280
...still clinging to winter's chill.

499
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,840
Your words are poison.

500
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,000
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

501
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Ah.

502
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,440
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

503
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,320
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

504
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,640
Your staff.

505
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,280
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

506
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,080
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

507
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,520
He's a herald of woe.

508
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,960
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

509
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,400
...Théoden King.

510
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,480
He's not welcome.

511
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,480
Why should I welcome you...

512
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,480
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

513
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,800
A just question, my liege.

514
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,720
Late is the hour...

515
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,680
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

516
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Láthspell I name him.

517
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,360
Ill news is an ill guest.

518
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,920
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

519
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,920
I have not passed
through fire and death...

520
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,200
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

521
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,160
His staff.

522
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,320
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

523
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,360
Théoden...

524
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,360
...son of Thengel...

525
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,320
...too long have you sat in the Shadows.

526
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,320
I would stay still if I were you.

527
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,480
Hearken to me!

528
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,840
I release you...

529
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,880
...from the spell.

530
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,840
You have no power here...

531
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,520
...Gandalf the Grey.

532
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,560
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

533
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,040
Wait.

534
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,120
If I go, Théoden dies.

535
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,880
You did not kill me...

536
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,160
...you will not kill him.

537
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,520
Rohan is mine.

538
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,240
Be gone.

539
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,960
I know your face.

540
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:18,000
Éowyn.

541
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,080
Gandalf?

542
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,320
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

543
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,680
Dark have been my dreams of late.

544
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,240
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

545
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,240
...if they grasped your sword.

546
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,440
I've only...

547
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,560
...ever served you, my lord.

548
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,520
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

549
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,320
Send me not from your sight.

550
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,160
No, my lord! No, my lord.

551
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,480
Let him go.

552
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,280
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

553
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,920
Get out of my way!

554
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,120
Hail, Théoden King!

555
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,160
Where is Théodred?

556
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,480
Where is my son?

557
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,840
Simbelmynë.

558
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,240
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

559
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,760
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

560
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,520
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

561
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,480
The young perish and the old linger.

562
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,080
That I should live...

563
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,440
...to see the last days of my house.

564
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,360
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

565
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,520
No parent should have to bury their child.

566
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,360
He was strong in life.

567
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,840
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

568
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,440
They had no warning.

569
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,920
They were unarmed.

570
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,240
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

571
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,000
Rick, cot and tree.

572
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,000
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.

573
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,240
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

574
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,640
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

575
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,040
Ride out and meet him head-on.

576
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,120
Draw him away from your women
and children.

577
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,000
You must fight.

578
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,840
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

579
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,560
Éomer is loyal to you.

580
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,320
His men will return
and fight for their king.

581
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:21,200
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

582
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,880
Éomer cannot help us.

583
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,200
I know what it is you want of me...

584
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,480
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

585
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,720
I will not risk open war.

586
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,040
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

587
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,720
When last I looked...

588
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,640
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

589
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,400
Then what is the king's decision?

590
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,000
By order of the king...

591
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,600
...the city must empty.

592
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,440
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

593
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,480
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

594
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,120
Helm's Deep.

595
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,680
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

596
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,720
Who will defend them if not their king?

597
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,240
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

598
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,120
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

599
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,040
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

600
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,320
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

601
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,560
What they will get is a massacre.

602
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,440
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

603
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,440
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

604
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,640
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

605
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,800
The people of Rohan will need you.

606
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,520
The defenses have to hold.

607
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,560
They will hold.

608
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,600
The Grey Pilgrim.

609
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,280
That's what they used to call me.

610
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,360
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

611
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,000
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

612
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,680
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

613
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,080
At dawn, look to the east.

614
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,760
Go.

615
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,480
You have some skill with a blade.

616
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,680
Women of this country learned long ago:

617
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,360
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

618
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,280
I fear neither death nor pain.

619
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,520
What do you fear, my lady?

620
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,520
A cage.

621
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,440
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

622
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,320
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

623
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,600
You're a daughter of kings...

624
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,960
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

625
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,440
I do not think that would be your fate.

626
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,400
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

627
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,560
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

628
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,520
He will expect an attack on the city.

629
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,920
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

630
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,320
...the great fortress of Rohan.

631
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,680
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

632
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,720
They will be slow.

633
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,320
They will have women and children
with them.

634
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,200
Send out your Warg-riders.

635
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,280
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

636
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,000
- Why do you do that?
- What?

637
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,600
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

638
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,960
Because.

639
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,480
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

640
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,760
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

641
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,800
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

642
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,160
You have no idea what it did to him...

643
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,720
...what it's still doing to him.

644
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
I want to help him, Sam.

645
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,200
Why?

646
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,320
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

647
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,240
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

648
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,000
What do you know about it? Nothing!

649
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:04,720
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.

650
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,600
I do.

651
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,320
It's the Ring.

652
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,400
You can't take your eyes off it.

653
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,960
I've seen you.

654
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,120
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

655
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,960
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

656
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,680
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

657
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,680
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

658
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,480
Mine! My own!

659
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,360
Can't you hear yourself?

660
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,120
Don't you know who you sound like?

661
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,000
We wants it.

662
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,760
We needs it.

663
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,520
Must have the precious.

664
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:58,000
They stole it from us.

665
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,360
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

666
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,280
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

667
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,560
No. Not master.

668
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,400
Yes, precious. False.

669
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,880
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

670
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,360
Master's my friend.

671
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,360
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

672
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,000
Not listening. I'm not listening.

673
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,000
You're a liar and a thief.

674
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,120
No.

675
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,760
Murderer.

676
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,120
Go away.

677
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,560
Go away?

678
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,600
I hate you.

679
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,080
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

680
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,000
I saved us.

681
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:01,520
It was me. We survived because of me.

682
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,120
Not anymore.

683
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,880
What did you say?

684
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,560
Master looks after us now.

685
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,080
We don't need you.

686
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,240
What?

687
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,120
Leave now...

688
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,920
...and never come back.

689
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,080
No.

690
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,600
Leave now and never come back.

691
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:39,760
Leave now and never come back!

692
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,840
We told him to go away.

693
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,840
And away he goes, precious.

694
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,920
Gone! Gone! Gone!

695
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,840
Sméagol is free!

696
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,960
Look.

697
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,440
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

698
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,920
They are young.

699
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,520
They are tender. They are nice.

700
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,080
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

701
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,200
You'll make him sick, you will...

702
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,440
...behaving like that.

703
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,400
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

704
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,640
What's it doing?

705
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,880
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

706
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,120
It ruins it.

707
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,800
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.

708
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,200
What we need is a few good taters.

709
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,000
What's taters, precious?

710
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,800
What's taters? Eh?

711
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,640
Po-ta-toes.

712
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,080
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

713
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,800
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

714
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,840
Even you couldn't say no to that.

715
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,280
Oh, yes, we could.

716
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:27,800
Spoil a nice fish.

717
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,560
Give it to us raw...

718
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,640
...and wriggling.

719
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,800
You keep nasty chips.

720
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,680
You're hopeless.

721
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,120
Mr. Frodo?

722
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,840
Who are they?
Wicked Men.

723
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,360
Servants of Sauron.

724
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,240
They are called to Mordor.

725
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,320
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

726
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,520
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

727
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,520
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

728
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,640
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

729
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,880
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

730
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,200
Mr. Frodo.

731
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,240
Look.

732
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,920
It's an oliphaunt.

733
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,680
No one at home will believe this.

734
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,160
Sméagol?

735
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,240
We've lingered here too long.

736
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,400
Come on, Sam.

737
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,760
Aye!

738
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,200
Bind their hands.

739
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,520
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

740
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:29,200
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

741
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,400
...that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

742
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,600
It's the beards.

743
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,840
This, in turn,
has given rise to the belief...

744
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,760
...that there are no Dwarf women...

745
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,000
...and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

746
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,400
...which is, of course, ridiculous.

747
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,440
GIMLl:
It's all right. Nobody panic.

748
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,640
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

749
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:20,200
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

750
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,240
It is mine to give to whom I will.

751
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,280
Like my heart.

752
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,240
Go to sleep.

753
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,800
I am asleep.

754
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,880
This is a dream.

755
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,080
Then it is a good dream.

756
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,640
Sleep.

757
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,840
Arwen...

758
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,040
Where is she?

759
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,520
The woman who gave you that jewel.

760
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:02,320
Our time here is ending.

761
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,440
Arwen's time is ending.

762
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,360
Let her go.

763
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,480
Let her take the ship into the west.

764
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,560
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

765
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,480
There it will be ever green.

766
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,160
But never more than memory.

767
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,320
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

768
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,960
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

769
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,320
She belongs with her people.

770
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,200
Why are you saying this?

771
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,760
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

772
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,080
It was a dream, Arwen.

773
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,800
Nothing more.

774
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,040
This belongs to you.

775
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,240
It was a gift.

776
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,240
Keep it.

777
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,800
My lord?

778
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:25,840
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

779
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:49,760
What is it?

780
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,200
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

781
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,040
Wargs!

782
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,680
A scout!

783
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,160
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

784
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,560
Get them out of here!

785
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,040
All riders to the head of the column.

786
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,640
GIMLl:
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

787
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,440
Come on!

788
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,120
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

789
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,720
- I can fight.
- No!

790
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,280
You must do this, for me.

791
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,960
Follow me! Hyah!

792
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:18,240
GIMLl: Forward. I mean, charge forward.
Make for the lower ground!

793
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,000
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

794
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:32,160
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

795
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,360
That one counts as mine!

796
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,920
Stinking creature.

797
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,440
Aragorn!

798
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,360
Aragorn?

799
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,560
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

800
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,120
He's...

801
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,200
...dead.

802
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,560
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

803
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,280
You lie.

804
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,360
Get the wounded on horses.

805
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,640
The wolves of Isengard will return.

806
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,080
Leave the dead.

807
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,640
Come.

808
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,920
At last!
Helm's Deep.

809
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,880
There it is, Helm's Deep.

810
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,040
We're safe!

811
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,240
We're safe, my lady.

812
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,560
Thank you.

813
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,440
Mama!
Éothain!

814
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,080
Freda!

815
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:59,880
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

816
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,040
So few. So few of you have returned.

817
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,880
Our people are safe.

818
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:19,600
We have paid for it with many lives.

819
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,880
GIMLl:
My lady.

820
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,600
Lord Aragorn...

821
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,960
...where is he?

822
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,360
He fell.

823
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,960
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

824
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,920
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

825
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:03,120
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

826
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,800
Get them into the caves.

827
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:11,280
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed
if he thinks he can reach us here.

828
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,520
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

829
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,920
Its outer wall is solid rock...

830
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:22,040
...but for a small culvert at its base...

831
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,880
...which is little more than a drain.

832
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,600
How? How can fire undo stone?

833
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,120
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

834
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,440
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

835
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,960
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

836
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,600
...thousands, to storm the Keep.

837
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,120
Tens of thousands.

838
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,200
But, my lord, there is no such force.

839
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,600
A new power is rising.

840
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,640
Its victory is at hand.

841
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,080
This night...

842
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,640
...the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

843
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,000
March to Helm's Deep!

844
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:31,520
Leave none alive!

845
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,320
To war!

846
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:44,360
There will be no dawn for Men.

847
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,800
Look. There's smoke to the south.

848
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,000
There is always smoke rising...

849
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:09,880
...from Isengard these days.

850
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,640
Isengard?

851
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,640
There was a time...

852
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,360
...when Saruman would walk in my woods.

853
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,720
But now he has a mind of metal...

854
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,720
...and wheels.

855
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:28,760
He no longer cares for growing things.

856
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,640
What is it?

857
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,560
It's Saruman's army.

858
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,240
The war has started.

859
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,160
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

860
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,880
Brego.

861
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,120
Arwen.

862
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,280
I have made my choice.

863
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,200
He is not coming back.

864
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,760
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

865
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,520
There is still hope.

866
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:55,120
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

867
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:01,200
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

868
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,760
...and all that you hope for
comes true...

869
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,440
...you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

870
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,600
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

871
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,560
...Aragorn will die.

872
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,760
And there will be no comfort
for you...

873
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,960
...no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

874
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:29,280
He will come to death...

875
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,920
...an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

876
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:36,560
...in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

877
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:49,080
But you, my daughter...

878
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:54,680
...you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

879
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:58,760
...as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

880
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,360
Here you will dwell...

881
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:08,240
...bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

882
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,800
...until all the world is changed...

883
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,280
...and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

884
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,600
Arwen.

885
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,160
There is nothing for you here...

886
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,280
...only death.

887
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,880
The power of the enemy is growing.

888
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,560
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...

889
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:16,040
...to destroy the people of Rohan.

890
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,520
Isengard has been unleashed.

891
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:28,880
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...

892
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,840
...the last free kingdom of Men.

893
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,200
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

894
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:43,760
He senses the Ring is close.

895
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,240
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

896
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:51,280
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...

897
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:56,480
...the quest will claim his life.

898
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,720
You know this.

899
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,000
You have foreseen it.

900
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:07,360
It is the risk we all took.

901
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:15,600
In the gathering dark,
the will of the Ring grows strong.

902
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,960
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

903
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:26,360
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

904
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,000
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

905
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:34,080
...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

906
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,160
It is close now.

907
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:42,400
So close to achieving its goal.

908
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,880
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

909
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:53,000
...even unto to the ending
of the world.

910
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:56,520
The time of the Elves...

911
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,560
...is over.

912
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,800
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

913
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:07,800
Do we let them stand alone?

914
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,520
What news?

915
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,400
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

916
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,280
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

917
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:23,320
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

918
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,800
Sauron is marshaling an army.

919
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,160
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

920
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,600
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

921
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:36,080
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

922
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,800
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

923
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,280
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

924
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,040
Sauron from Mordor.

925
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,400
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

926
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,200
Gondor is weak.

927
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:55,360
Sauron will strike us soon.

928
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,840
And he will strike hard.

929
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:02,200
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

930
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,680
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

931
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,480
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

932
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,800
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

933
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,080
Speak.

934
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,640
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

935
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,840
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

936
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,720
Your bodyguard?

937
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,600
His gardener.

938
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,080
And where is your skulking friend?

939
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,760
That gangrel creature.

940
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,960
He had an ill-favored look.

941
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,440
There was no other.

942
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,600
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

943
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,760
One we lost in Moria...

944
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,240
...two were my kin...

945
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,000
...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

946
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:15,920
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

947
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,400
You're a friend of Boromir?

948
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,160
Yes.

949
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,240
For my part.

950
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,320
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

951
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,680
Dead?

952
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,800
How? When?

953
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,600
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

954
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,880
He was my brother.

955
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,240
Captain Faramir!

956
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,600
We found the third one.

957
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:29,600
You must come with me. Now.

958
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,440
Down there.

959
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,480
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

960
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,120
They wait for my command.

961
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,400
Shall I shoot?

962
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,520
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

963
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,440
So juicy sweet

964
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,880
Our only wish
To catch a fish

965
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,640
So juicy sweet

966
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,720
Wait.

967
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,880
This creature is bound to me.

968
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:43,280
And I to him.

969
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,680
He is our guide.

970
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,560
Please...

971
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:55,520
...let me go down to him.

972
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,920
Sméagol.

973
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,040
Master is here.

974
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,280
Come, Sméagol.

975
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:18,560
Trust master. Come.

976
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:25,280
We must go now?

977
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:28,920
Sméagol, you must trust master.

978
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,440
Follow me. Come on.

979
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,120
Come.

980
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,680
Come, Sméagol.

981
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,120
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

982
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,080
Come on.

983
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:46,920
Don't hurt him!

984
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,680
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

985
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,120
Master!

986
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,560
No! No!

987
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,600
Where are you leading them?

988
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,920
Answer me.

989
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,800
Sméagol.

990
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:26,640
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

991
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,360
Cruel Men hurts us.

992
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,400
Master tricksed us.

993
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:37,000
Of course he did.

994
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,880
I told you he was tricksy.

995
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,960
I told you he was false.

996
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:46,720
Master is our friend.

997
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,160
Our friend.

998
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,400
Master betrayed us.

999
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,440
No. Not its business.

1000
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,800
Leave us alone!

1001
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:00,240
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1002
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,640
They stole it from us!

1003
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,160
No. No.

1004
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,280
What did they steal?

1005
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:13,440
My precious!

1006
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,560
We have to get out of here.

1007
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:21,040
You go. Go, now.

1008
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,320
You can do it.

1009
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,080
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1010
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:30,000
Just this once.

1011
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:31,840
Put it on.

1012
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,200
Disappear.

1013
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,240
I can't.

1014
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:41,360
You were right, Sam.

1015
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,120
You tried to tell me but...

1016
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:51,720
I'm sorry.

1017
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,800
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1018
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:01,760
If I put it on...

1019
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,160
...he'll find me.

1020
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,640
He'll see.

1021
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,720
Mr. Frodo...

1022
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:19,560
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1023
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,560
Here in the Wild I have you...

1024
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,520
...two Halflings...

1025
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:29,720
...and a host of men at my call.

1026
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,240
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1027
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,120
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1028
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:53,560
...to show his quality.

1029
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,360
No!

1030
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,680
Stop it!

1031
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:20,880
Leave him alone.

1032
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:24,560
Don't you understand?

1033
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,600
He's got to destroy it!

1034
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,880
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1035
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,640
To the Mountain of Fire!

1036
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:36,640
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1037
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,680
Please. It's such a burden.

1038
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,760
Will you not help him?

1039
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,880
Captain?

1040
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,680
Prepare to leave.

1041
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,720
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1042
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:09,280
He's alive!
Where is he? Where is he?

1043
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:12,400
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1044
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,160
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1045
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,200
...and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1046
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:22,280
Bless you, laddie.

1047
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,480
Gimli, where is the king?

1048
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:38,960
You look terrible.

1049
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
A great host, you say?

1050
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:23,720
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1051
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:27,240
Ten thousand strong at least.

1052
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,080
Ten thousand?

1053
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,880
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1054
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,520
To destroy the world of Men.

1055
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,840
They will be here by nightfall.

1056
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:48,680
Let them come!

1057
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:52,760
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1058
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:55,920
...to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1059
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,640
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1060
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,160
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1061
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:11,920
...or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1062
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,400
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1063
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,080
These are Uruk-hai.

1064
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:20,560
Their armor is thick
and their shields broad.

1065
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:25,640
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1066
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:29,240
I know how to defend my own keep.

1067
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:38,840
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1068
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,040
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1069
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:46,800
Crops can be resown...

1070
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,840
...homes rebuilt.

1071
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,880
Within these walls...

1072
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:54,640
...we will outlast them.

1073
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,120
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1074
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,800
They come to destroy its people...

1075
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,360
...down to the last child.

1076
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,360
What would you have me do?

1077
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,160
Look at my men.

1078
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,000
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1079
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:14,320
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1080
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,400
...as to be worthy of remembrance.

1081
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,720
Send out riders, my lord.

1082
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,760
You must call for aid.

1083
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,080
And who will come?

1084
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,000
Elves?

1085
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:35,120
Dwarves?

1086
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:38,640
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1087
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,600
The old alliances are dead.

1088
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,720
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1089
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,960
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1090
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,000
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1091
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:53,040
Where was Gon...?

1092
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,440
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1093
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,360
...we are alone.

1094
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,600
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1095
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:10,960
We need more time
to lay provisions...

1096
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:14,480
There is no time. War is upon us.

1097
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,400
Secure the gate.

1098
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,400
We Ents have not troubled...

1099
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:26,800
...about the wars of Men and wizards...

1100
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:30,400
...for a very long time.

1101
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:36,200
But now, something
is about to happen...

1102
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:38,600
...that has not happened...

1103
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,160
...for an age.

1104
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,480
Entmoot.

1105
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:45,840
What's that?

1106
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:48,960
'Tis a gathering.

1107
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:52,560
A gathering of what?

1108
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,040
Beech. Oak.

1109
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,000
Chestnut. Ash.

1110
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:16,160
Good. Good. Good.

1111
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,600
Many have come.

1112
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,480
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1113
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:31,120
...will go to war.

1114
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:42,640
Move back! Move to the caves!

1115
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,680
Keep moving.
Quickly now.

1116
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,160
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1117
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,920
These are no soldiers.

1118
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,160
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1119
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:55,720
Look at them. They're frightened.

1120
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,280
You can see it in their eyes.

1121
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:12,440
Aragorn.

1122
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,440
Then I shall die as one of them!

1123
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,400
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.

1124
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,840
Let him be.

1125
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:36,480
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armory.

1126
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:42,400
My lord?

1127
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,840
Who am I, Gamling?

1128
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:53,840
You are our king, sire.

1129
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,840
And do you trust your king?

1130
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,360
Your men, my lord...

1131
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,200
...will follow you to whatever end.

1132
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,600
To whatever end.

1133
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,480
Where is the horse and the rider?

1134
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:31,600
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1135
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:37,280
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1136
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:41,360
Like wind in the meadow.

1137
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:48,480
The days have gone down in the West...

1138
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,680
...behind the hills...

1139
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,080
...into Shadow.

1140
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:06,480
How did it come to this?

1141
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:13,240
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1142
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,360
Give me your sword.

1143
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:41,600
What is your name?

1144
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:44,400
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1145
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:48,960
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1146
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:52,720
They say that it is hopeless.

1147
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,400
This is a good sword.

1148
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,600
Haleth, son of Háma...

1149
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,840
...there is always hope.

1150
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:47,080
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1151
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:48,720
Forgive me.

1152
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,280
I was wrong to despair.

1153
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:01,800
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1154
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:07,080
It's a little tight across the chest.

1155
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,880
That is no Orc horn.

1156
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:22,080
Send for the king.

1157
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:25,680
- Open the gate!
Open up the gate!

1158
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:57,680
How is this possible?

1159
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:02,120
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1160
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:05,360
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1161
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:10,120
Long ago we fought and died together.

1162
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:15,080
We come to honor that allegiance.

1163
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:25,040
You are most welcome.

1164
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:34,000
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1165
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:09,360
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.

1166
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:18,080
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1167
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:25,680
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1168
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,720
Let's hope they last the night.

1169
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:28,160
ARAGORN

1170
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,680
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1171
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:11,600
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1172
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:13,960
So it begins.

1173
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,040
Did they hit anything?

1174
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:43,600
Give them a volley.

1175
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:45,760
- Fire!
- Fire!

1176
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:02,480
Send them to me! Come on!

1177
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,440
Good!

1178
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,800
Swords! Swords!

1179
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,640
Legolas! Two already!

1180
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:05,360
I'm on 17!

1181
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:08,480
Huh? I'll have no pointy-ear
outscoring me!

1182
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,680
Nineteen!

1183
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,760
Merry.

1184
02:10:56,240 --> 02:10:59,920
We have just agreed.

1185
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:09,040
Yes?

1186
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:13,520
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1187
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:17,680
...and we have agreed...

1188
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:22,000
...you are not Orcs.

1189
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,920
Well, that's good news.

1190
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:29,040
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1191
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:33,320
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1192
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:34,960
Hasty?

1193
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:37,320
Our friends are out there.

1194
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:41,480
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1195
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:43,960
War? Yes.

1196
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:45,960
It affects us all.

1197
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:50,600
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1198
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,640
...it takes a long time...

1199
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:57,520
...to say anything in Old Entish...

1200
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:01,720
...and we never say anything...

1201
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:05,640
...unless it is worth taking...

1202
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:09,680
...a long time to say.

1203
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:13,640
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1204
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:14,800
Nineteen!

1205
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:17,160
Twenty!

1206
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:18,920
Twenty-one!

1207
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:23,280
Twenty-two and 23!

1208
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,840
Causeway!

1209
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:40,240
Is this it?

1210
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:43,200
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

1211
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:06,960
Brace the gate!

1212
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:26,720
Hold them! Stand firm!

1213
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:35,560
Aragorn!

1214
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,160
Gimli!

1215
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:31,400
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1216
02:15:32,120 --> 02:15:36,000
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1217
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:38,800
How can that be your decision?!

1218
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:42,920
This is not our war.

1219
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:45,320
But you're part of this world!

1220
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:51,040
Aren't you?!

1221
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:57,200
You must help. Please.

1222
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:01,120
You must do something.

1223
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:05,520
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1224
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:10,240
But your part in this tale is over.

1225
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:12,560
Go back to your home.

1226
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:24,320
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1227
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:26,280
We don't belong here, Merry.

1228
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:28,600
It's too big for us.

1229
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:31,320
What can we do in the end?

1230
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:36,080
We've got the Shire.

1231
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:39,000
Maybe we should go home.

1232
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:43,880
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1233
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:48,720
...and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1234
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:50,440
And...

1235
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:55,120
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1236
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:01,320
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1237
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:21,200
Aragorn!

1238
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:23,640
Fall back to the Keep!

1239
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:26,800
Get your men out of there!

1240
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,640
Haldir!

1241
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:44,720
GIMLl: What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1242
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:04,320
Haldir!

1243
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,840
Brace the gate!

1244
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:48,880
Hold them!

1245
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:53,840
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1246
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:18,600
Make way!

1247
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:23,040
We cannot hold much longer!

1248
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:32,200
Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1249
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:34,800
As long as you can give me.

1250
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:36,560
Gimli!

1251
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,280
Timbers!

1252
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:41,360
Brace the gate!

1253
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:57,160
Oh, come on. We can take them.

1254
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:59,520
It's a long way.

1255
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:06,240
Toss me.

1256
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:09,120
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1257
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:10,800
You'll have to toss me!

1258
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:17,360
Don't tell the Elf.

1259
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:19,600
Not a word.

1260
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:35,600
Shore up the door!

1261
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:37,760
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.

1262
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:38,960
Watch our backs!

1263
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:45,040
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1264
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:34,320
Hold fast the gate!

1265
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:41,200
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

1266
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:47,280
Aragorn!

1267
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:21,680
Pull everybody back.

1268
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,760
Pull them back.

1269
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:28,240
Fall back!

1270
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:30,960
They have broken through!

1271
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:33,320
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1272
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,600
Fall back!
Retreat!

1273
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:38,280
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1274
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:40,600
Into the Keep!

1275
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:56,360
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1276
02:22:56,520 --> 02:23:01,040
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1277
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:07,760
Wait! Stop!

1278
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:10,040
Stop!

1279
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,680
Turn around.

1280
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:18,160
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1281
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:23,120
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1282
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:26,000
Yes. Exactly.

1283
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:29,280
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1284
02:23:29,440 --> 02:23:32,000
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1285
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:34,080
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1286
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:39,480
That doesn't make sense to me.

1287
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:40,760
But then...

1288
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:43,520
...you are very small.

1289
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:45,360
Perhaps you're right.

1290
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:49,360
South it is, then.

1291
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:54,000
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1292
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:58,640
I always like going south.

1293
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:02,920
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1294
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:05,840
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1295
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,880
No, we won't.

1296
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:10,760
Not this time.

1297
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:18,120
Look!

1298
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,000
Osgiliath burns!

1299
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:23,560
Mordor has come.

1300
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:26,960
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1301
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:30,320
It has only the power to destroy.

1302
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:32,560
Please...

1303
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:34,320
...let me go.

1304
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:36,840
Hurry.

1305
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:41,520
Faramir!

1306
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:44,080
You must let me go!

1307
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:47,760
And those little family of field mice...

1308
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:50,640
...that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1309
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:54,520
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1310
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:08,080
Many of these trees were my friends.

1311
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:13,200
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1312
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:15,440
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1313
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:18,280
They had voices of their own.

1314
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,880
Saruman.

1315
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:26,160
A wizard should know better!

1316
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:43,320
There is no curse in Elvish...

1317
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:46,080
...Entish or the tongues of Men...

1318
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:48,480
...for this treachery.

1319
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:53,640
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1320
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:56,320
...with rock and stone.

1321
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:20,360
Yes.

1322
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:22,800
Come, my friends.

1323
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:28,080
The Ents are going to war.

1324
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:29,960
It is likely...

1325
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:33,520
...that we go to our doom.

1326
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:37,200
Last march...

1327
02:26:37,720 --> 02:26:39,680
...of the Ents.

1328
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:29,400
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.

1329
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:31,560
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1330
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:35,600
Mr. Frodo?

1331
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,840
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1332
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,400
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

1333
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:57,480
Take them to my father.

1334
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:01,840
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1335
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:07,080
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1336
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:10,800
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1337
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:14,040
You want to know
why your brother died?

1338
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:18,080
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1339
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,080
He tried to kill him!

1340
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:22,480
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1341
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:25,000
Watch out!

1342
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:36,560
Mr. Frodo?

1343
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:40,840
They're here.

1344
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:46,160
They've come.

1345
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:50,480
Nazgûl!

1346
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,760
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1347
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:17,640
Take cover!

1348
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:35,760
The fortress is taken.

1349
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:37,640
It is over.

1350
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:41,560
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1351
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:44,560
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1352
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:48,520
They're breaking in!

1353
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:53,440
They're past the door!

1354
02:29:56,640 --> 02:30:00,600
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1355
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:05,040
Is there no other way?

1356
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:09,480
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1357
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:12,240
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1358
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:19,200
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1359
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:22,120
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1360
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:27,440
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1361
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:33,320
Ride out with me.

1362
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:38,800
Ride out and meet them.

1363
02:30:39,560 --> 02:30:41,640
For death and glory.

1364
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:43,120
For Rohan.

1365
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:46,000
For your people.

1366
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:48,560
The sun is rising.

1367
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:55,760
Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.

1368
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,240
At dawn...

1369
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:59,040
...look to the east.

1370
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:08,600
Yes.

1371
02:31:09,880 --> 02:31:12,200
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1372
02:31:12,360 --> 02:31:15,040
...shall sound in the Deep...

1373
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:17,360
...one last time.

1374
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:18,960
Yes!

1375
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:25,520
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1376
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,280
Fell deeds, awake.

1377
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:36,480
Now for wrath...

1378
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:39,920
...now for ruin and a red dawn.

1379
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:48,840
Forth Eorlingas!

1380
02:32:34,640 --> 02:32:35,840
Gandalf.

1381
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:46,320
Théoden King stands alone.

1382
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:49,000
Not alone.

1383
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:50,480
Rohirrim!

1384
02:32:56,120 --> 02:32:57,240
Éomer.

1385
02:32:57,400 --> 02:32:59,840
To the king!

1386
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:15,960
Yes!

1387
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:27,840
A hit. A fine hit.

1388
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:53,960
Break the dam!

1389
02:34:54,120 --> 02:34:57,400
Release the river!

1390
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:26,240
Pippin! Hold on!

1391
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:34,120
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1392
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:15,720
What are you doing?

1393
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,440
Where are you going?

1394
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:22,480
It's me.

1395
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:27,000
It's your Sam.

1396
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:33,680
Don't you know your Sam?

1397
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:53,920
I can't do this, Sam.

1398
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:56,720
I know.

1399
02:37:57,680 --> 02:37:59,920
It's all wrong.

1400
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:02,600
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1401
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:11,720
But we are.

1402
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:20,760
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1403
02:38:20,920 --> 02:38:23,240
The ones that really mattered.

1404
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:27,120
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1405
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:30,120
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1406
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:33,080
...because how could the end be happy?

1407
02:38:35,560 --> 02:38:37,680
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1408
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:39,720
...when so much bad had happened?

1409
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:42,440
Victory!

1410
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:44,840
We have victory!

1411
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:50,400
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

1412
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:51,920
...this shadow.

1413
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:55,040
Even darkness must pass.

1414
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:57,520
A new day will come.

1415
02:38:58,360 --> 02:39:02,480
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1416
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:06,360
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1417
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:08,080
...that meant something.

1418
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:11,080
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1419
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:15,640
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1420
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:17,440
I know now.

1421
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,440
Folk in those stories...

1422
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:24,560
...had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1423
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:26,880
They kept going...

1424
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:30,640
...because they were holding
on to something.

1425
02:39:32,200 --> 02:39:34,400
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1426
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:49,640
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1427
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:52,320
And it's worth fighting for.

1428
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:22,240
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1429
02:40:22,960 --> 02:40:26,760
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1430
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:29,040
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1431
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:34,560
Then it is forfeit.

1432
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:38,920
Release them.

1433
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:54,000
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1434
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:03,760
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1435
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:07,760
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

1436
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:16,000
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

1437
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:20,040
...somewhere in the wilderness.

1438
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:26,480
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1439
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:27,920
What?

1440
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:31,920
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1441
02:41:32,080 --> 02:41:35,200
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1442
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:38,160
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1443
02:41:38,320 --> 02:41:39,920
"Yes, my boy.

1444
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:43,760
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1445
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:46,320
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1446
02:41:46,480 --> 02:41:48,320
"Samwise the Brave."

1447
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:51,120
I want to hear more about Sam.

1448
02:41:55,240 --> 02:41:58,120
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1449
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:03,280
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1450
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:05,640
So was I.

1451
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:16,720
"Samwise the Brave."

1452
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:22,120
Sméagol?

1453
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:25,040
We're not going
to wait for you. Come on.

1454
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:27,080
Master.

1455
02:42:27,240 --> 02:42:30,080
Master looks after us.

1456
02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:33,520
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1457
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:36,040
Master broke his promise.

1458
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:38,280
Don't ask Sméagol.

1459
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:41,520
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1460
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:44,400
Master betrayed us.

1461
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:47,520
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1462
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:51,440
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1463
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:54,200
Kill him! Kill him!

1464
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:55,800
Kill them both!

1465
02:42:55,960 --> 02:42:59,440
And then we take the precious...

1466
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:03,000
...and we be the master!

1467
02:43:03,640 --> 02:43:06,200
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1468
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:08,920
Eyes always watching.

1469
02:43:09,080 --> 02:43:12,520
Then we stabs them out.

1470
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:17,000
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1471
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:20,480
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1472
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:23,240
Kill them both.

1473
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:25,800
Yes. No! No!

1474
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:29,520
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1475
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:32,680
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1476
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:35,320
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
Sméagol?

1477
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:40,680
We could let her do it.

1478
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:45,560
Yes. She could do it.

1479
02:43:45,720 --> 02:43:50,120
Yes, precious, she could.

1480
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:56,080
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1481
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:58,720
Once they're dead.

1482
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:01,720
Shh.

1483
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:07,440
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1484
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:09,600
Sméagol will show you the way.

1485
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:11,920
Follow me.
