1
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,000
They've killed the boy!
They've killed young Paolo!

2
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,800
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,000
My son...

5
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,800
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,800
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,500
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,200
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,700
He never speaks.

11
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,300
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,700
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,900
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,100
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,000
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,500
He's all I have left.

18
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,700
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,200
Move and I'll kill him!

20
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Run, Vito!

21
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Kill him!

22
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

23
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,000
You understand?

24
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,200
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

25
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,700
Vito, we're praying for you!

26
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,400
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

27
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,900
...turn him over to us.

28
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,300
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

29
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,100
lt'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

30
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

31
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,700
The nurse.

32
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
- Do you have any money?
- No.

33
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,100
Interpreter.

34
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Where are you from?

35
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,600
- What is your name?
- Maria.

36
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
What is your name?

37
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,300
Come on, son.
What is your name?

38
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,000
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

39
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,400
Vito Corleone.

40
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,800
Okay. Over there.

41
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Next. Your name.

42
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,500
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine, three months.

43
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,300
Vito Corleone?

44
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,700
Here he is.
This is him.

45
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,200
Did you bring the car keys?

46
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,800
- Look who's here.
- Father Carmelo.

47
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,000
- This is Father Carmelo.
- I'm Merle Johnson.

48
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Excuse me.

49
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,400
- Here I am.
- After one week?

50
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,300
I sent the car out to the airport
last week to pick you up.
It was chaos.

51
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,300
Anyway, here I am,
just one week late.

52
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,400
And this is for my mama.
- What is this?
- You remember Merle, don't you?

53
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,100
- Hello, Mama.
- Yeah, hello.

54
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
How are you?
Thank you.

55
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
Where's Michael?
I gotta talk to him...

56
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,000
and get a few things straight,
and I can't wait on line.

57
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,900
You go see your children first...

58
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,600
and then you worry about waiting
on line to see your brother...
Like everybody else.

59
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,000
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Frankie, wake up.

60
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,200
A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.

61
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,500
Would you please welcome Senator
Pat Geary of the state of Nevada.

62
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
And there's Mrs. Geary.

63
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

64
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,700
And this is a very,
very happy day for me...

65
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
and my wife, Mrs. Geary.

66
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
We see Nevada far too seldom...

67
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
but particularly today...

68
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,200
when we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends...

69
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,900
and we help celebrate
a young man's first communion...

70
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,600
and also to thank
that boy's family...

71
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,800
for a magnificent contribution
to the state.

72
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,700
I have here in my hand a check...

73
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,000
made out to the university...

74
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,700
and it is
a magnificent endowment...

75
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
in the name of...

76
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,800
Anthony Vito Corleone.

77
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,000
And the check is signed
by that young man's parents...

78
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,100
whom I think
we should recognize now.
Mike, Pat, Kay--

79
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Stand up, please.
Let the folks see you.
Folks, I want you to join with me...

80
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,900
in giving a real
Nevada thank-you...

81
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,600
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!

82
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,400
We also have,
as a special added attraction...
the Sierra Boys Choir...

83
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,900
who have chosen...

84
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,600
a certain special song
and a special arrangement...

85
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,500
to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.

86
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Boys.

87
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,300
- Why this feeling
- Why this feeling

88
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,600
- Why this glow
-Just why this glow

89
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,000
The plaque.

90
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,400
Okay, fellas, I got that one.

91
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,400
Okay, this is yours.

92
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,100
Senator, just you and Mrs. Corleone.

93
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,200
- Excuse me.
- This is my lawyer Tom Hagen.

94
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,100
- Senator Geary.
- Mr. Hagen.

95
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,200
He's the one who arranged this whole
thing through your man Turnbull.

96
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,400
- Yes, yes.
- Sit down.

97
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,100
I was under the impression
that you and I would talk alone.

98
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I trust these men
with my life, Senator.

99
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,700
If I were to ask them to leave,
it would be an insult.

100
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,400
It's all right with me, but I should
tell you I am a blunt man...

101
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,200
and I intend to speak
very frankly to you...

102
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,600
more frankly than anyone in my
position's talked to you before.

103
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,300
The Corleone family has done
very well here in Nevada.

104
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,500
You own, or you control,
two major hotels in Vegas...

105
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,900
one in Reno.

106
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The licenses
were grandfathered in...

107
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,500
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission.

108
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,200
But now my sources tell me that...

109
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,600
you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

110
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,500
They tell me that within a week...
you're gonna move Klingman out.

111
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,700
That's quite an expansion.

112
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,700
However, it will leave you
with one little technical problem.

113
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,300
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

114
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,400
Turnbull is a good man.
Yeah, well, let's just--
Let's cut out the bullshit.

115
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't want to spend any more time
here than I have to.
You can have the license.

116
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,200
The price is $250,000...

117
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,900
plus a monthly payment
of five percent of the gross...
of all four hotels...

118
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,700
Mr. Corleone.

119
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,100
Now, the price for the license
is less than $20,000.

120
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,500
- Am I right?
- That's right.

121
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,800
Now, why would I ever consider
paying more than that?
Because I intend to squeeze you.

122
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,400
I don't like your kind of people.

123
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,300
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country...
in your oily hair...

124
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:32,000
dressed up in those silk suits...
and you try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

125
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,700
I'll do business with you,
but the fact is that...
I despise your masquerade...

126
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,600
the dishonest way
you pose yourself--

127
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,500
yourself and your whole
fucking family.

128
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,900
Senator...

129
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,900
we're both part
of the same hypocrisy...

130
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,500
but never think it applies
to my family.

131
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,100
All right, all right.

132
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Some people have to play
little games.

133
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,100
You play yours.

134
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,900
Let's just say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest to.

135
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But I want your answer
and the money by noon tomorrow.

136
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,200
And one more thing:
Don't you contact me again, ever.

137
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,100
From now on, you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

138
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,400
Senator, you can have
my answer now if you like.

139
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,000
My offer is this:

140
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,500
nothing.

141
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Not even the fee
for the gaming license...

142
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,800
which I would appreciate
if you would put up personally.

143
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,900
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

144
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
Ladies. I didn't know
you were out here.

145
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
- We have to go. We're late.
- Really? I'm sorry.

146
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,800
It's been a delightful party.
Thank you for inviting us.

147
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,500
It's been our pleasure.
It was wonderful talking to you.

148
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,100
Fredo, you son ofa bitch!

149
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,900
You look great!

150
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,800
Frank Pentangeli!

151
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,400
I thought you was never
coming out west, you big bum.

152
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,400
I gotta check on my boys, huh?

153
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,700
- What's with the food around here?
- What's the matter?

154
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,400
Kid comes up to me
in a white jacket...

155
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,400
gives me a Ritz cracker
and a chopped liver...
he says "canapes."

156
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,400
I said,"Can of peas my ass!

157
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,400
That's a Ritz cracker
and chopped liver."

158
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,700
- Bring out the peppers and sausage.
- Hey, Freddie.

159
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,300
Seeing you reminds me of New York.
The old days, huh?

160
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,600
Hey, Fredo,
you remember Willi Cicci?

161
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,600
We was with old man Clemenza
in Brooklyn.

162
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,900
We were all upset about that.

163
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Heart attack, huh?
No, there was no heart attack.

164
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,600
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

165
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,600
- But what's with him?
- What do you mean?

166
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,600
I mean, what do I gotta do?
Do I have to get...

167
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,900
a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

168
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,200
You can't get in to see Mike?
He's got me waiting in a lobby!

169
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,900
-Johnny Ola.
- AI Neri.

170
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,600
Do you know my lawyer
Tom Hagen? Johnny Ola.

171
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,200
Sure. I remember Tom
from the old days.

172
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,100
Rocco, what's this?

173
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,800
It's an orange from Miami.

174
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

175
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,800
- Good to see you.
- Tom isn't gonna sit in with us.

176
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,400
He only handles specifiic areas
of the family business.

177
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
- Tom?
- Sure, Mike.

178
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,800
What are you drinking, Johnny?
Anisette.

179
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,500
If you need anything
I'll be outside, all right?
Just tell Rocco we're waiting.

180
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,100
I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.

181
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,900
- How's his health?
- It's not good.

182
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,300
Is there anything I can do,
anything I can send?

183
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,000
He appreciates your concern,
Michael, and your respect.

184
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
That casino you're interested in,
the registered owners are...

185
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,200
Jacob Lawrence, Allan Barclay,
both Beverly Hills attorneys.

186
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,500
The real owners are the Lakeville
Road group from Cleveland...
and our friend in Miami.

187
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,800
Meyer Klingman runs the store.
He owns a piece of it too,
and he does all right.

188
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,600
But I've been instructed to tell you
that if you move Klingman out...

189
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,200
our friend in Miami will go along.

190
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
That's very kind of him.

191
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,600
You tell him
that's greatly appreciated.

192
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,400
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

193
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,200
One by one,
our old friends are gone.

194
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
Death, natural or not...

195
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
prison, deported.

196
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,000
Hyman Roth is the only one left...
because he always made money
for his partners.

197
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,300
My God!
I can't believe...

198
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,800
out of 30 professional musicians...
there isn't one Italian
in the group here.

199
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,400
Come on.
Let's have a tarantella.

200
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,300
You, up! Come on!
Up, up, up!

201
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,500
I'll see my sister alone.

202
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,100
It concerns me too.
Is it okay if I stay?
How are you, honey?

203
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
You've met Merle.
He was with me in Vegas.

204
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,100
- I saw him with you.
- Could I have a drink or something?

205
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,200
Al, would you please
get him a drink?

206
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,000
We're going to Europe. I'd like
to book passage on the Queen.

207
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,800
So what do you come to me for?
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

208
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
We're getting married first.

209
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,000
The ink on your divorce isn't dry
yet, and you're getting married?

210
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,500
You see your children on weekends.

211
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,900
Your oldest boy
was picked up in Reno...

212
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,100
for some petty theft
you don't even know about.

213
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
You fly around the world with men
who use you like a whore.

214
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,100
- You're not my father!
- Then what do you come to me for?
'Cause I need money.

215
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,700
I wanna be reasonable with you.

216
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,400
Now, why don't you stay here
with us, with the family?

217
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,300
You can live here on the estate
with your kids.

218
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,700
You won't be deprived of anything.
You can have everything you want.

219
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,900
Now, I don't know this Merle.
I don't know what he does.

220
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,200
I don't know what he lives on.

221
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,200
Tell him marriage
is out ofthe question...

222
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,200
and you don't want
to see him anymore.

223
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,700
He'll understand.
Believe me.

224
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,800
If you don't listen to me...

225
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,800
and marry this man...

226
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
you'll disappoint me.

227
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,900
What's cent'anni?

228
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,700
Cent'anni.
It means a hundred years.

229
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It means we should all live happily
for a hundred years, the family.

230
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,700
It'd be true
if my father were alive.

231
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Merle, you've met
my sister-in-law Deanna.

232
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,800
- Fredo's wife.
- A pleasure, Merle.

233
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,300
- How do you do?
- My pleasure.

234
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
What did she mean by that?

235
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,000
What's the matter?
I just wanna dance.

236
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,100
Dancing is one thing.
You're falling all over the floor.

237
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,700
I know what's the matter. You're
jealous 'cause he's a real man.

238
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,800
I swear to God, I'm gonna
belt you right in the teeth.
You couldn't belt your mama.

239
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,300
You know something? These dagos are
crazy when it comes to their wives.

240
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,500
Michael says that if
you can't take care of this...
I have to.

241
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,300
- I think you'd better.
- Never marry a Wop!

242
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,200
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop!

243
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,100
Stop that!

244
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
What are you doing to me?

245
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,600
You big slob! Help!

246
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,600
I can't control her, Mikey.
You're my brother, Fredo.
You don't have to apologize to me.

247
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,700
Clemenza promised
the Rosato brothers...

248
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,700
three territories in the Bronx
after he died.

249
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,700
You took over,
and you didn't give it to them.

250
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,800
- I welched?
- You welched.
Clemenza promised them "ugatz."

251
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,900
Clemenza promised them nothing.
He hated those son ofa bitches
more than I do.

252
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Frankie, they feel cheated.

253
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,500
You're sitting high up
in the Sierra Mountains...

254
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,700
and you're drinking--
- What's he drinking, Cicci?
- Champagne.

255
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,700
Champagne cocktails.

256
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,200
And you're passing judgment
on how I run my family.

257
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,100
You're a good old man.

258
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
I like you.

259
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
And you were loyal
to my father for years.

260
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,800
The Rosato brothers,
they're taking hostages.

261
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,600
And Mike,
they spit right in my face...

262
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
all because they're backed up
by that Jew in Miami.

263
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,900
I know. That's why
I don't want 'em touched.

264
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,600
- You don't want 'em touched.
- No.
I want you to be fair with them.

265
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,100
You want me to be fair with 'em?

266
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,100
How can you be fair to animals?
Tom, for Christ's sakes, listen.

267
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,600
They recruit spics.
They recruit niggers.

268
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,500
And they do violence in
their grandmothers' neighborhoods.

269
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,500
And I tell ya,
everything with them is whores.
Whores and junk. Dope.

270
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,200
And they leave the gambling to last.

271
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,200
Now, I wanna run my family
without you on my back...

272
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,200
and I want those
Rosato brothers dead.

273
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,400
Now, I have business that's
important with Hyman Roth.
I don't want it disturbed.

274
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,900
Then you'll give your loyalty
to a Jew before your own blood?

275
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,800
Come on. You know my father
did business with Hyman Roth.
He respected him.

276
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Your father did business
with Hyman Roth...
your father respected Hyman Roth...

277
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,200
but your father
never trusted Hyman Roth...

278
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,000
or his Sicilian messenger boy
Johnny Ola.

279
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,800
And I want everybody here to know...
there's not gonna be
no trouble from me.

280
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,800
Don Corleone.

281
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,800
You want him to leave now?

282
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,900
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

283
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,700
The old man had too much wine.

284
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
It's late.

285
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,500
How's the baby?

286
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,300
Sleeping inside me.

287
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,100
- Does it feel like a boy?
- Yes, it does, Michael.

288
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,100
I'm sorry about
all the people today.
Bad timing.

289
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,500
It couldn't be helped, though.

290
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
It made me think
of what you once told me.

291
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,600
In five years, the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate.

292
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
That was seven years ago.

293
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,000
I know.

294
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,800
I'm trying, darling.

295
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
Did you see this?

296
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,100
Michael, why are the drapes open?

297
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,800
- Kay, you all right?
- Yeah.

298
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,300
- Are you hit?
- No.

299
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,400
It's over. It's over.

300
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,600
Now! Shut it off!

301
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,800
Hold it!

302
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,800
They're still on the property.
Please, stay inside.

303
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,000
- Keep them alive.
- We'll try.
Rocco! Alive!

304
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,400
Stay by the door.

305
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,100
Check by the boathouse!

306
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,300
Yeah, come in.

307
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,600
- Mike, are you all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah?

308
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,700
There's a lot
I can't tell you, Tom.

309
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,500
Now, I know that's
upset you in the past.

310
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,100
You felt it was because of some
lack of trust or confidence...

311
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,800
but it's because
I admire you and I love you...

312
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,500
that I kept things
secret from you.

313
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,600
That's why at this moment you're
the only one I can completely trust.

314
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,200
Fredo?

315
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,100
Well, he's got a good heart...

316
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,100
but he's weak and he's stupid...
and this is life and death.

317
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,500
Tom, you're my brother.

318
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,600
I always wanted to be thought of
as a brother by you.
A real brother.

319
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,000
I know that.

320
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,800
You're gonna take over.

321
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,200
You're gonna be the don.

322
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,400
If what I think has happened
has happened...

323
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,700
I'm gonna leave here tonight.

324
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,800
I give you complete power
over Fredo and his men--

325
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Rocco, Neri, everyone.

326
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,900
I'm trusting you with the lives
of my wife and my children--

327
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,100
the future of this family.

328
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,900
When we catch these guys...

329
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,300
do you think we'll be able to
find out who's back ofall this?
We're not gonna catch 'em.

330
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,400
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

331
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,100
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

332
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,700
Inside.

333
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,300
Very, very frightened
they botched it.

334
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,600
Yeah, but your people,
Rocco and Neri...

335
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,400
you don't think that they had
something to do with this?

336
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,400
See, all our people
are businessmen.

337
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,500
Their loyalty's based on that.

338
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,600
One thing I learned from Pop...

339
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,300
was to try to think
as people around you think.

340
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Now, on that basis,
anything's possible.

341
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,800
I seen them!
Right out my window!

342
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,100
I wanna get out of here!
They're lying there dead!
Get her inside!

343
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,400
Over here.
There's two of'em.

344
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Looks like they were
hired out of New York.
I don't recognize 'em.

345
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,700
We won't get anything
out of them now.

346
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,300
Fish 'em out.

347
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,600
All right, get rid of the bodies.

348
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,800
- Where's Mike?
- Rocco.

349
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,900
Anthony, everything's
gonna be all right.

350
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,500
Try to sleep.

351
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,700
Did you like your party?

352
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,000
I got lots of presents.
I know.
Did you like 'em?

353
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,200
I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

354
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,800
Well, they're my friends.

355
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,800
Did you see my present for you?
It was on my pillow.

356
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,100
Anthony, I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

357
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,400
Will you take me?

358
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,800
- No, I can't, Anthony.
- Why do you have to go?

359
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,800
'Cause I have to do business.

360
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,700
I could help you.

361
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,600
Well, someday you will.

362
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,100
Get some sleep.

363
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,500
Good night.

364
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,200
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

365
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,600
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

366
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,800
I left Naples. I left Mama.

367
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,800
For a no-good tramp!

368
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,800
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

369
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,100
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

370
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,900
Without news from home.

371
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,700
Finally, a letter from Naples!

372
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,800
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

373
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,200
She's very beautiful.

374
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,500
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

375
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,700
Our dear mother -

376
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,700
...is dead!

377
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,800
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

378
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,000
Sit down, you bum!

379
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,500
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

380
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,600
We'll go see her backstage.

381
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,900
Who was that?

382
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,000
The Black Hand.

383
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,600
That's Fanucci... the Black Hand.

384
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,300
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

385
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,900
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

386
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,400
You'll pay me today!

387
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,000
Let's go.

388
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,200
Not my daughter! Let her go!

389
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,800
Here, take all my money!

390
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,500
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

391
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,400
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

392
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Even my father, in the grocery store.
If he's Italian...

393
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,200
...why does he bother other Italians?

394
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,600
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

395
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,200
If you're happy, I'm happy.

396
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,000
Don't you feel well?

397
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,800
Is your boss treating you all right?

398
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,100
Forget it.

399
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,200
Hide this for me!

400
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,400
Next week I'll come and get it!

401
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,000
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

402
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,800
How's business?

403
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,500
It's good, it's good.

404
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,900
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

405
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,800
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

406
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

407
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,200
So Fanucci's changing?

408
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,100
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

409
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,300
Even from my father.

410
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,900
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

411
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,200
I've got some bad news.

412
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,400
I feel rotten about telling you this...

413
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,600
But Fanucci... he's got a nephew...

414
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:04,900
And you have to give him my job.
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

415
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,600
You looked after me like a father.

416
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,200
I thank you.

417
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,000
And I won't forget it.

418
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,000
Vito!

419
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,700
Oh, no!

420
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,400
Take this to your family.

421
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,500
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

422
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,800
What a nice pear!

423
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,100
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

424
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,700
Did you look inside?

425
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,600
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

426
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,800
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

427
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,900
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

428
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,700
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

429
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,400
My wife would like it.

430
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:59,000
The son of a bitch! He isn't home!

431
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,900
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

432
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,100
Well, he won't mind.

433
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,500
This is your friend's place?

434
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,500
This is a real palace.

435
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,500
One of the best.

436
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,000
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

437
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,500
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

438
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,600
Come on in.

439
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,200
It's all right. Come on.
Hyman's in there.

440
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:32,100
I was just making some lunch.
Would you like a tuna sandwich?
Uh, no, thankyou.

441
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,100
Pickup of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...

442
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,800
and the ball is at
the Trojan 38-yardline.
Mr. Roth?

443
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,700
Come in, Michael.

444
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,800
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

445
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,200
It's almost over.

446
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:01,400
You follow the football game?
- Pickup offive.
- Not for a while I haven't.

447
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,200
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

448
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:09,200
One of the things I love
about this country.
Baseball too.

449
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,200
I've loved baseball...

450
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,000
ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

451
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,400
...47. Marked down there,
say the officials.

452
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,600
And at that point
it'll be first and ten--
I heard you had some trouble.

453
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,500
It'll be third and ten, another
of those big plays now...

454
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,200
- Stupid.
- coming up for S.C.

455
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,400
People behaving like that
with guns.

456
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,000
...but it looks like
it could stall here.

457
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,800
The important thing is,
you're all right.

458
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,600
Good health.
The most important thing.

459
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,200
More than success.
More than money.

460
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,900
- Now he's back to pass.
- More than power.

461
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Rolls up field for Hayes.
He's intercepted.

462
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,600
Hurd has it to the Irish 40.
To the far sideline. Gets by the 45.

463
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,900
He's hit and dropped
at the S.C. 42-yardline.

464
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,500
Notre Dame's first bigbreak
of the game.

465
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,200
I came here because there's
gonna be more bloodshed.

466
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,600
I want you to know about it
before it happens...

467
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,000
so that there's no danger
of starting another war.
Nobody wants another war.

468
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,700
Frank Pentangeli came to my home
and he asked my permission...

469
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,600
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.
When I refused,
he tried to have me killed.

470
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,000
He was stupid. I was lucky.
I'll visit him soon.

471
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,400
The important thing is that
nothing interfere...

472
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,800
with our plans for the future.
- Yours and mine.
- Nothing is more important.

473
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,400
Good.

474
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,400
You're a wise
and considerate young man.

475
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,100
And you're a great man,
Mr. Roth.

476
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,100
- There's much I can learn from you.
- What can I do to help, Michael?

477
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,900
To the 32, and is downed there
by Danny Zika.

478
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,400
- Excuse me. Lunch.
- Oh.

479
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,300
- Okay.
- Ohh!

480
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,200
Hyman, you're gonna
break my ear drums.

481
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,600
- Okay, enjoy it.
- Thanks.

482
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,900
You're young.
I'm old and sick.

483
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,800
What we'll do together
in the next few months...
will make history, Michael.

484
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,700
History.
It's never been done before.

485
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,100
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

486
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,800
And Pentangeli is a dead man.

487
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,800
- You don't object?
- Pickup of four.

488
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,700
He's small potatoes.

489
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,400
What's up?

490
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,400
We got company, huh?

491
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,800
Don Corleone, I wish you would've
let me know you were comin'.

492
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,200
I could've prepared
something for you.

493
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,200
I didn't want you to know
I was coming.

494
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,800
You heard what happened
in my home?

495
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,700
- Mike, I almost died myself.
- In my home!

496
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,800
In my bedroom
where my wife sleeps!

497
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,300
Where my children come
and play with their toys.

498
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,200
In my home.

499
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,600
I want you to help me
take my revenge.

500
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,600
Michael, anything.

501
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,500
What can I do?

502
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,300
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

503
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,000
Mike, I don't understand.
I don't--

504
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,400
I don't have your brain
for big deals...
but this is a street thing.

505
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,500
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
That--

506
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,800
He's backin' up
those son-of-a-bitches.
I know.

507
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,300
Then why? Why do you ask me
to lay down to him, Mike?

508
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,000
It was Hyman Roth that
tried to have me killed.

509
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,800
I know it was him.

510
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,200
Jesus Christ, Mike.

511
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,100
Jesus Christ, look,
let's get 'em all.

512
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,400
Let's hit 'em all now,
while we got the muscle.

513
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,600
This used to be
my father's old study.

514
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,500
It's changed.

515
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,200
I remember
there used to be a--

516
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,100
A big desk was here.

517
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,800
I remember when I was a kid,
Frankie...

518
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,200
we had to be very quiet
when we played near here.

519
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,800
I was very happy that this
house never went to strangers.

520
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.

521
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,200
My father taught me
many things here.

522
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,400
He taught me in this room.

523
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,000
He taught me,
keep your friends close...

524
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,400
but your enemies closer.

525
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,700
Now, if Hyman Roth sees that
I interceded in this thing...

526
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,600
in the Rosato brothers' favor...

527
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,300
he's gonna think his relationship
with me is still good.

528
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,600
That's what I want him to think.

529
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,200
I want him completely relaxed
and confident in our friendship.

530
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,400
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

531
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,600
- Yeah?
- Fredo. This is Johnny.

532
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,100
Johnny Ola.
We need some more help.
Johnny?

533
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,000
Jesus Christ,
what the hell time is it?

534
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,000
- Who is that, honey?
- Listen good, Fredo.

535
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
What are you callin' me here for?
I don't want to talk to you.

536
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,200
Pentangeli's set up a meeting
with the Rosato brothers.

537
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,600
- He's gonna go for their deal.
- Oh, God.

538
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,100
- Will he come alone?
- I don't know anything.

539
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,600
- You got me in deep enough already.
- Just go along.

540
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,600
Everything will be allright,
Fredo.

541
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,000
Pentangeli says he's
willing to make a deal.

542
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
All we wanna know is
if he's on the level.

543
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,300
You guys lied to me. I don't
want you to call me anymore.

544
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,800
Your brother's not gonna
find out we talked.

545
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,600
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

546
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,000
Who was that?

547
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,900
Uh, wrong number.

548
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,600
Frank, I got nobody here.

549
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,500
- Wait in the car, Cheech.
- Frankie--
It's okay, Cheech.

550
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:10,100
- What's this, Rosato?
- A lucky "C" note for our new deal.

551
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,200
Richie.
Give us a taste, huh?

552
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,500
Yeah, we're all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

553
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,800
- You're not gonna regret it.
- I don't like this "C" note.

554
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,300
I take that as an insult.

555
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,600
Michael Corleone says hello.

556
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,900
Get him in!
Close the fuckin' door!

557
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,400
Your friend the cop.
What the--

558
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,000
Hey, Rich, it's dark in here.

559
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,300
- Are you open or closed?
- I just come in to clean up.

560
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,800
What's the matter?

561
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,800
- Is that somethin' on the floor?
- Carmine, no, no. Not here!

562
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,100
- Not here!
- Not here, Carmine! Not a cop!
What?

563
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,700
You open your fuckin' mouth,
I'll blow your head off!

564
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,600
Freddie. Good to see ya.

565
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,100
Where is he?

566
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,700
He's okay. He's in the back.

567
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,100
Come on, girls.
Take a hike, huh?

568
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,700
In this room here.

569
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,800
- I wanna talk to him alone first.
- Come on, huh?

570
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,000
I thought I could
help you, Senator.

571
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,900
Hagen?

572
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,600
- Listen, Hagen, I did not--
- No.

573
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:52,800
- It's all right.
- I didn't do anything.
It's okay.

574
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,100
You're very lucky.

575
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:00,400
My brother Fredo
operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

576
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,100
Now, if this had happened
someplace else...

577
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,500
we couldn't
have helped you.

578
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,400
When I woke up
I was on the floor...

579
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,200
and I don't know
how it happened.
You can't remember?

580
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,800
I passed out.

581
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,300
I'll fix it.

582
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,200
Okay.

583
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,300
It was just a game.

584
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,700
Jesus.

585
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,200
Oh.

586
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,500
Jesus! Jesus!

587
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,400
Jesus God.

588
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,300
Oh, God.

589
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,100
I don't know and I don't
understand why I can't remember.

590
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,000
You don't have to remember.
Just do as I say.

591
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,500
They're putting a call in
to your office.

592
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,400
Explain that you'll be there
tomorrow afternoon.

593
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:21,400
You decided to spend the night...
at Michael Corleone's house
in Tahoe as his guest.

594
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,800
I do remember
that she was laughing.

595
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,600
We'd done it before...

596
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,900
and I know that I could
not have hurt that girl.

597
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,800
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows
that she worked here.

598
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,600
It'll be as though
she never existed.

599
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,400
All that's left
is our friendship.

600
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,000
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.

601
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,900
- We're not to let you through.
- I'm just going to the market.

602
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,500
Well, if you'll just give us a list,
we'll pick up anything you want.

603
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,700
- Whose orders are these?
- Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. He's coming.

604
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,600
All right, well, I'm just gonna
have to speak to Mr. Hagen.

605
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:22,400
I wanted to explain this, but
I had business in Carson City.

606
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,400
Now, this is Michael's
request for your safety.

607
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,000
- We can send out for anything.
- I see.

608
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,000
I'm supposed to stay
in my house.

609
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,500
No, within the compound
would be fine.

610
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,800
I was going to take the children
to New England next week.

611
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,000
- That's off now.
- Am I a prisoner? Is that it?

612
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,400
- That's not the way we look at it.
- All right, come on, kids.

613
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,800
We're going back to the house.

614
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,400
Joe.

615
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,000
Cuba! Cuba!

616
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:13,300
Most respected gentlemen...

617
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,600
allow me to welcome you
to the city of Havana.

618
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:22,300
I want to thank this distinguished
group of American industrialists...

619
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,900
for continuing to work
with Cuba...

620
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,800
toward the greatest period
of prosperity...

621
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,400
in her entire history.

622
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,600
Mr. William Shaw, representing
the General Fruit Company;

623
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,000
Misters Corngold and Dant...
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company;

624
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,300
Mr. Petty,
regional vice president...

625
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,200
of the Pan American
Mining Corporation;

626
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,300
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar;,

627
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,100
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada...

628
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,500
representing our associates in
tourism and leisure activities;

629
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,400
and my old friend and associate
from Florida...

630
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Mr. Hyman Roth.

631
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,800
I would like to take this
opportunity...

632
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,600
to thank United
Telephone and Telegraph...
for their lovely Christmas gift:

633
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,000
a solid gold telephone.

634
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,200
Perhaps you gentlemen would
like to take a look at it.

635
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,400
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

636
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,500
Perhaps you would discuss
the status of rebel activity...

637
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,200
and what this can mean
to our businesses.

638
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,700
- Of course.
- Very lovely.

639
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,200
I want to assure you
that although the rebels...

640
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,800
have mounted an impressive
campaign in Las Villas...

641
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,500
my staff indicates
with assurance...

642
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,300
we'll drive them out of the city
of Santa Clara before the new year.

643
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,400
And I want to put you all
at ease.

644
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,400
We will tolerate no guerillas
in the casinos or swimming pools.

645
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,100
He say that they are
making arrest...

646
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,200
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

647
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,400
Johnny.

648
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Well, I hope my age
is correct.

649
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,100
I'm always accurate
about my age.

650
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,900
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

651
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,900
I'm very pleased...

652
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,300
you were all able to come
from such distances...
to be with me today.

653
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:21,000
When a man comes
to this point in his life...

654
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,300
he wants to turn over the
things he's been blessed with--
turn them over to friends--

655
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,400
as a reward
for the friends he's had...

656
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:36,600
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

657
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,200
- Not for years.
- Hear, hear.

658
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:43,000
The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

659
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,200
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana...

660
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,300
and there's no limit to
where we can go from here.

661
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,000
This kind of government knows how
to help business, to encourage it.

662
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,900
The hotels here
are bigger and swankier...

663
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,600
than any of the rough joints
we've put in in Vegas.

664
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,900
And we can thank our friends
in the Cuban government...

665
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,400
which has put up half of the cash,
with the Teamsters...
on a dollar-for-dollar basis;

666
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,200
has relaxed restrictions
on imports.

667
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,600
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed:

668
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,300
real partnership
with a government.

669
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,900
Smaller piece.

670
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,400
You all know Michael Corleone...

671
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:32,300
and we all remember his father.
At the time of my retirement
or death...

672
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,600
I turn over all my interest
in the Havana operation...

673
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,900
to his control.
But all of you will share.

674
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,600
The Nacionale will go to
the Lakeville Road boys.

675
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:51,300
The Capri to the Corleone family.
The Sevilla Biltmore also.

676
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,100
But Eddie Levine of Newport will
bring in the Pennino brothers...

677
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,700
Dino and Eddie, for a piece...
and also to handle
the actual casino operations.

678
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,300
And we've saved a piece for
some friends in Nevada...

679
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:06,800
to make sure that things
go smooth back home.

680
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:11,700
I want all of you
to enjoy your cake...

681
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,600
so enjoy.

682
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,300
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

683
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:21,100
I saw an interesting thing
happen today.

684
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:26,000
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police...
and rather than be taken alive...

685
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,600
he exploded a grenade he had
hidden in his jacket.

686
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:32,000
He killed himself, and he took
a captain of the command with him.

687
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,200
- Right, Johnny?
- Those rebels, they're lunatics.

688
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,400
- Yes, I agree.
- Maybe so.

689
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,400
But it occurred to me...
the soldiers are paid to fight,
the rebels aren't.

690
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,500
What does that tell you?

691
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,400
They could win.

692
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,900
This country has had rebels
for the last 50 years.

693
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,400
It's in their blood. I've been
coming here since the '20s.

694
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,200
We were running molasses out
of Havana when you were a baby...

695
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,800
the trucks owned by your father.

696
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,200
Michael.

697
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,600
I'd rather we talked about
this when we we're alone.

698
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,600
The two million
never got to the island.

699
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,100
I wouldn't want it to get around
that you held back the money...

700
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,500
because you had second thoughts
about the rebels.

701
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,400
Ah, sit down, Michael.

702
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,300
Sit down.

703
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:51,200
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

704
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,500
Ohh.

705
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,000
What I wouldn't give for...

706
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,900
20 more years.

707
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,800
Here we are, protected--

708
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,900
free to make our profiits without
Kefauver...

709
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,600
the goddamn Justice
Department and the FBl--

710
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:11,300
90 miles away, partnership
with a friendly government.

711
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,400
Ninety miles. It's nothing.

712
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,000
Just one small step,
looking for a man...

713
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,200
that wants to be President
of the United States...

714
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,500
and having the cash
to make it possible.

715
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,400
Michael...

716
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,700
we're bigger than U.S.Steel.

717
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,100
Mikey, how are ya? Okay?

718
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,600
Hiya. Freddie Corleone.

719
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,900
Jesus Christ, what a trip.

720
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,500
The whole time I'm thinkin'...
"What if somebody knows
what I got in here?"

721
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,800
Imagine that. Two million dollars
on the seat next to me.

722
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,700
All right.

723
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,900
- Whoops. Excuse me.
- No, it's okay.

724
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,500
You wanna count it?

725
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,100
Mikey, what the hell's
goin' on anyway?

726
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,300
The family's making
an investment in Havana.

727
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,600
- This is a gift for the president.
- Oh.

728
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,600
Well, that's great.

729
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,500
Havana's great.

730
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,400
It's my kind of town.

731
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:52,100
- Anybody I know in Havana?
- I don't know.
Hyman Roth? Johnny Ola?

732
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,600
No. I never met them.

733
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,500
Listen, Mikey...

734
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,400
I'm kind of, uh--

735
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,700
kind of nervous from the trip.
Uh, can I-- can I get
a, uh, drink or somethin'?

736
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,900
I thought maybe we'd--
we'd go out together.

737
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,500
I know a place we can spend
some time together. Okay?

738
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:27,700
Sometimes I think I should've
married a woman like you did...
Like Kay.

739
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,100
Have kids, have a family.

740
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,900
For once in my life
be more like...

741
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,800
Pop.

742
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:45,500
It's not easy to be a son,
Fredo. It's not easy.

743
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,600
Mama used to tease me. She'd say,
"You don't belong to me.

744
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,100
You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies."

745
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,900
Sometimes I think it's true.

746
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,900
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

747
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,300
Mikey, I--

748
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,200
I was mad at you.

749
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,000
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

750
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,600
You want a drink, right?
Waiter.

751
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,600
- How do you say banana daiquiri?
- Banana daiquiri.

752
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,900
- That's it?
- That's it.

753
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,200
- Uh, uno banana daiquiri.
- Banana daiquiri. Si, senor.
And, uh, a club soda.

754
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,400
Senator Geary's flying in
from Washington tomorrow night...

755
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,800
with some people,
some government people...

756
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,200
and I want you to show 'em
a good time in Havana.

757
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,500
It's my specialty, right?

758
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,000
- Can I trust you with something?
- Ofcourse, Mike.

759
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,500
In the evening, we're all invited
to the presidential palace...

760
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,000
a reception to bring in
the new year.
After it's over...

761
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,100
they're gonna take me home
in a military car...
alone, for my protection...

762
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,500
and before I reach my hotel
I'll be assassinated.

763
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,000
- Who?
- Roth.

764
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,700
It was Roth who tried
to kill me in my home.

765
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:50,100
It was Roth all along.

766
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:55,200
He acts like I'm his son,
his successor...

767
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:59,100
but he thinks he's gonna live
forever and he wants me out.

768
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,400
How can I help?
You just go along
as though you know nothing.

769
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:11,300
- I've already made my move.
- What move?

770
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,100
Hyman Roth'll never see
the new year.

771
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,900
He says you have to take it easy
and he'll give you a prescription.

772
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,600
He'll be back tomorrow.
I want my own doctor.
Fly him in from Miami.

773
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,700
I don't trust a doctor
can't speak English.

774
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,100
Honey, go down to the casino.
- If you're sure you're better.
- Feel fine.

775
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,700
- Play the bingo game.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

776
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,700
-Just make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

777
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,300
My sixth sense tells me...
your brother Fredo brought
a bag full of money.

778
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,400
Where is it?

779
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,900
You're pulling out?

780
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,700
Just wanna--
I just wanna wait.

781
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,400
How do you feel?

782
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,800
Terrible. I'd give four million...
just to be able to take a piss
without it hurting.

783
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,100
Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?

784
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,500
The Rosato brothers.

785
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,000
I know. But who gave
the go-ahead?

786
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,900
I know I didn't.

787
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:46,400
There was this kid
I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

788
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:52,400
Sort of looked up to me,
you know.
We did our first work together.

789
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,500
Worked our way
out of the street.

790
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,500
Things were good.
We made the most of it.

791
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,200
During Prohibition...

792
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:04,600
we ran molasses into Canada.
Made a fortune. Your father too.

793
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,000
As much as anyone...

794
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,500
I loved him and trusted him.

795
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,800
Later on he had an idea...

796
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,900
to build a city...

797
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,200
out of a desert stopover for G.I. s
on their way to the West Coast.

798
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,100
That kid's name was Moe Green...

799
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,300
and the city he invented
was Las Vegas.

800
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,300
This was a great man...

801
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,800
a man of vision and guts...

802
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,900
and there isn't even a plaque
or a signpost or a statue of him...

803
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,800
in that town.

804
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,200
Someone put a bullet
through his eye.

805
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,600
No one knows
who gave the order.

806
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,700
When I heard it I wasn't angry.

807
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,800
I knew Moe;
I knew he was headstrong.

808
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,600
Talking loud,
saying stupid things.

809
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,800
So when he turned up dead...

810
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,000
I let it go...

811
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,200
and I said to myself...

812
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,000
"This is the business
we've chosen."

813
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,800
I didn't ask...

814
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,700
who gave the order...

815
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,800
because it had nothing
to do with business.

816
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:37,600
That two million
in a bag in your room--

817
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,300
I'm going in...

818
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,400
to take a nap.

819
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,500
When I wake...

820
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,200
if the money's on the table
I'll know I have a partner.

821
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,600
If it isn't,
I'll know I don't.

822
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,000
All right, does everybody
know everybody here, huh?

823
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,900
- This is Senator Geary.
- How are you, Senator?

824
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,100
Good to see you, Mike. I'm glad
we could spend time together.

825
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,200
- Senator Payton from Florida.
- How you doing, Mike?

826
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,600
- And Judge DeMalco from New York.
- How do you do, sir?

827
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,800
- Fine, thank you.
- Senator Ream from Maryland.

828
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:04,000
- I've been looking forward to this.
- This is Fred Corngold from U.T.T.

829
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,500
- I know Fred. How are you?
- Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha.

830
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,000
- Oh, he does, huh?
- Gentlemen, it's refiill time.

831
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,400
Try some of them local drinks--
uh, cuba libre, pina colada.

832
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:19,200
I think I'll try one of
those redheaded Yolandas.

833
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:23,000
- That you got. Congusto.
- Johnny.

834
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,600
You don't know my brother Fredo,
do you, Johnny? Johnny Ola, Fredo.

835
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,500
- We never met. Johnny Ola.
- Pleasure.

836
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,700
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

837
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,600
- Happy New Year.
- That's right, huh?

838
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,500
- Checkin' in now. Right now.
- Never fear! Pat Geary's here!

839
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,300
- Hey, Fred.
- Cheers! Hey!

840
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,800
- Hey, Freddie, why are we standin'?
- Come on, man!

841
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:54,600
Everybody stands,
but it's worth it.

842
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,400
- You're not gonna believe this.
- I don't believe it already.

843
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,000
- That's right. Fifty dollars.
- You got a bet, mister.

844
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,300
That's him. That's Superman.

845
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,000
- Jesus Christ!
- Did I tell ya, or did I tell ya?

846
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,300
- I don't believe it.
- That thing's gotta be a fake.

847
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:53,100
That ain't no fake. That's real.
That's why they call him Superman.

848
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,100
Hey, Freddie. Freddie.
Where did you find this place?

849
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,400
Johnny Ola told me about
this place. He brought me here.

850
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,400
I didn't believe it,
but seein' is believin', huh?

851
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:06,400
- I see it and I don't believe it.
- Fifty bucks, Pat.
Old man Roth'd never come here...

852
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,200
but ol'Johnny knows these places
like the back of his hand.

853
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:15,000
Now watch him. He's gonna
break the cracker with it.
I wanna see him break a brick.

854
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,500
He could knock down a building.

855
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,100
Relax, Senor Roth. We're
taking you to the hospital.

856
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,100
And in my judgment
you'll continue to get those...

857
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,500
because I don't believe
that President Eisenhower...
will ever pull out of Cuba.

858
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:29,100
Not as long as we have over one billion
dollars invested in this country.

859
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,700
Now, the American public
believes in nonintervention.

860
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,500
Fredo. Where you goin'?

861
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,800
I'm gonna get me a real drink,
'cause I can't--

862
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,800
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.

863
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:41,200
Ream, what's the protocol? How long
should we stay around here?

864
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,100
Oh, I don't know. I think
a half hour oughta do it.

865
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,200
Just long enough
to bring in the new year.

866
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:21,200
There's a plane waiting for us
to take us to Miami in an hour.

867
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,600
Don't make a big thing about it.

868
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,700
I know it was you, Fredo.

869
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,500
You broke my heart.

870
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,500
You broke my heart.

871
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,700
Fredo! Come on.

872
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:21,600
Come with me. It's the only
way out of here tonight.
Roth is dead. Fredo.

873
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:27,300
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother!
Fredo! Fredo!

874
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,400
U.S. passports only.

875
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,500
- U.S. passports only.
- I'm from the United States Senate.

876
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:59,900
- Back, please.
- Please! I must leave!

877
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,900
Al, get me a wet towel.

878
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,400
Kay know I'm back?

879
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,200
What about my boy? Did you get
him something for Christmas?

880
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:27,700
- I took care of it.
- What was it so I'll know?

881
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:33,000
It was a little car with an electric
motor that he could ride in.
It was nice.

882
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,900
Thank you, Al.

883
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,500
Fellas, could you step outside
for a minute, please?

884
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,600
Where's my brother?

885
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,400
Uh, Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

886
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,300
He had a stroke.
He recovered okay.

887
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,800
- Your bodyguard's dead.
- I asked about Fredo.

888
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,300
I think he got out. He must be
somewhere in New York.

889
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,400
All right.

890
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,200
I want you to get
in touch with him.

891
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:26,900
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything's all right.
Tell him I know Roth misled him;

892
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,400
that he didn't know
they were gonna try to kill me.

893
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,500
And they can come in now.

894
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,200
Oh, there was something else.

895
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:38,800
What?

896
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,500
What?
Come on. What?

897
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:50,800
Kay had a miscarriage.
She lost the baby.

898
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,700
- Was it a boy?
- After three and a half months--

899
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,900
Can't you give me a straight answer
anymore? Was it a boy?

900
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,300
I really don't know.

901
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:37,200
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

902
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,700
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

903
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:28,700
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

904
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:31,400
You know I've got three daughters.

905
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,600
This is my neighborhood.

906
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:37,200
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

907
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:41,800
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

908
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:47,800
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

909
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,700
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

910
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:58,100
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

911
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.
And your family will be ruined.

912
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:11,500
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

913
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:16,000
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

914
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,600
Now don't refuse me.

915
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:21,700
Understand, paesano?

916
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:29,400
I understand.

917
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:36,300
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

918
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:42,400
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

919
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:47,800
Don't be afraid to tell them!

920
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,800
600 bucks...

921
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,100
Suppose we don't pay?

922
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,700
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

923
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:04,500
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

924
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:09,500
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.
$200 each... everybody agreed?

925
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:18,700
Why do we have to pay him?
Vito, leave this to us.

926
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,900
He's one person, we're three.

927
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:24,800
He's got guns, we've got guns.

928
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,200
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

929
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,900
This is his neighborhood!

930
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:36,800
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

931
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,900
They don't pay Fanucci.

932
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:51,100
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

933
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:56,200
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

934
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:13,200
Now what I say stays in this room.

935
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:18,400
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

936
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,700
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

937
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
If Fanucci says $200...

938
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:34,100
...he means it, Vito!
I'll reason with him.

939
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,300
Leave everything to me.

940
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:45,200
I'll take care of everything.
I never lie to my friends.

941
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:48,200
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

942
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,100
He'll ask for the money.

943
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:57,000
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

944
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:00,000
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

945
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:04,800
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

946
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,100
How can you get him to take less?

947
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:10,800
That's my business.

948
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,300
Just remember that I did you a favor.

949
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,900
Is it a deal?

950
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,200
His family's out of the house.

951
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,000
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

952
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:20,800
Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.

953
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,400
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

954
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,300
It looks like there's -
$100 under my hat.

955
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:31,500
I was right.

956
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,700
Only $100...

957
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:40,800
I'm short of money right now.

958
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,100
I've been out of work... so just
give me a little time.

959
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,700
You understand, don't you?

960
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:59,500
You've got balls, young man!

961
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,800
How come I never heard
of you before?

962
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:13,100
You've got a lot of guts.

963
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,300
I'll find you some work
for good money.

964
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,700
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

965
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:39,600
You've done well for yourself.

966
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:45,000
Enjoy the festa!

967
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:51,300
Oh, this is too violent for me!

968
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
What've you got there?

969
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:45,100
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

970
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,700
Tell me something, Ma.

971
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:55,400
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

972
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,300
You already know that.

973
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:03,800
He was being strong...

974
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:11,200
Strong for his family.

975
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:23,100
But by being strong for his family...

976
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,400
...could he...

977
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,300
...lose it?

978
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:36,600
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

979
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:41,700
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

980
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:46,900
No, I meant... lose his family.

981
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:52,200
But you can never lose your family.

982
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,200
Times are changing.

983
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:27,500
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

984
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:29,900
Take it as a gift.

985
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:55,600
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

986
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:03,000
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

987
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:05,500
<i>She's in bad trouble.</i>

988
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:10,500
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

989
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:14,200
<i>He told her to get rid of the animal.</i>

990
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,400
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

991
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:23,600
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

992
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:28,600
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

993
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:31,400
I'm so ashamed!

994
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:36,600
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

995
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,300
I'm sorry, but...

996
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:45,800
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

997
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,500
I can't move!

998
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,800
I want you to talk to him!

999
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,200
Tell him I want to stay here!

1000
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:02,900
What's your landlord's name?

1001
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:05,200
His name is Signor Roberto.

1002
02:09:05,500 --> 02:09:08,100
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

1003
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:11,900
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

1004
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:14,600
A real pig-sty, eh?

1005
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:36,800
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

1006
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,200
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

1007
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:44,600
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

1008
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:48,900
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

1009
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:53,100
I already rented the place
to another family.

1010
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:02,700
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

1011
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:07,500
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

1012
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:09,500
So let her stay.

1013
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:12,000
Impossible.

1014
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:15,700
Are you Sicilian?
No, I'm Calabrese.

1015
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:19,000
We're practically paesani,
do me this favor.

1016
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,500
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

1017
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:25,600
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

1018
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:28,400
How much more a month?

1019
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,900
Five bucks.

1020
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:37,800
Here's six months increase in advance.

1021
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,900
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

1022
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:45,100
Come see me in another six months.

1023
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:49,500
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

1024
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,200
The dog stays.

1025
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:58,700
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

1026
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:04,700
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

1027
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:06,900
Do me this favor.

1028
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:09,700
I won't forget it.

1029
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:14,400
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

1030
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:18,700
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

1031
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:25,800
What a character!

1032
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:38,100
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

1033
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:49,200
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

1034
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:58,900
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

1035
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:02,300
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1036
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:06,700
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1037
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:11,700
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1038
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,900
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1039
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:31,100
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1040
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:41,500
Can I sit down?

1041
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:47,200
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1042
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:51,000
The rent stays like before!

1043
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
I'll even lower it.

1044
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:07,200
I'll lower it $5.

1045
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:11,400
I'll lower it $10!

1046
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,400
Can I offer you some coffee?

1047
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:26,600
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1048
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:33,900
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1049
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:41,400
I wish I could stay longer!

1050
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,900
Just call me and I'll be here!

1051
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:02,200
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1052
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:36,400
- Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
- Yes, I am.

1053
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:40,300
- And where was he born?
- Corleone, Sicily.

1054
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:45,900
Did he, at times, use an alias...
that was known in certain circles
as "Godfather"?

1055
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:49,600
"Godfather" is a term
that was used by his friends...

1056
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:53,400
one of affection,
one of respect.

1057
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:57,800
Mr. Chairman, I would like
to verify the witness's statement.

1058
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:03,000
For years now, a growing number
of my constituents...
have been of Italian descent...

1059
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,900
and I've come to know them well.

1060
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:10,000
They have honored me with their
support and with their friendship.

1061
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:15,200
Indeed, I can proudly say
that some of my very best friends...
are Italian-Americans.

1062
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,900
However, Mr. Chairman, at this time,
I have to leave these proceedings...

1063
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,700
to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.

1064
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:28,800
But before I leave,
I do want to say this--

1065
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:33,200
that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever...

1066
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:35,500
a slur upon
the great Italian people...

1067
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:38,700
because I can state from
my own knowledge and experience...

1068
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:42,300
that Italian-Americans are among
the most loyal...

1069
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,700
most law-abiding, patriotic...

1070
02:15:44,700 --> 02:15:48,200
hard-working American citizens
in this land.

1071
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,600
And it would be a shame,
Mr. Chairman...

1072
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,800
if we allowed
a few rotten apples...

1073
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:55,500
to give a bad name
to the whole barrel...

1074
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:58,100
because from the time
of the great Christopher Columbus...

1075
02:15:58,200 --> 02:16:00,800
up to the time of Enrico Fermi...

1076
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,800
right up until the present day...
Italian-Americans
have been pioneers...

1077
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:09,200
in building and defending
our great nation.
They are the salt of the earth.

1078
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:12,600
They are one of the backbones
of this country.

1079
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:18,500
The chairman is calling
the meeting back to order.

1080
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:22,000
I'm sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague.

1081
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:25,900
Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been
advised as to your legal rights.

1082
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,600
We have testimony from a witness,
a previous witness...

1083
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:32,000
one Willi Cicci.

1084
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:36,300
He has stated that you are head...
of the most powerful Mafia family
in this country.

1085
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:39,200
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

1086
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:42,600
The witness has testified that
you are personally responsible...

1087
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:46,200
for the murder of a New York City
police captain in 1947.

1088
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:49,900
And with him,
a man named Virgil Solozzo.

1089
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:55,400
- Do you deny this?
- Yes, I do.
Is it true that in the year 1950...

1090
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:59,800
you devised a murder of the heads
of the so-called "five families"...

1091
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:04,400
in New York, to assume
and consolidate...
your nefarious power?

1092
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:08,200
- That's a complete falsehood.
- Is it true...

1093
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:12,400
you have a controlling interest
in three major hotels in Las Vegas?

1094
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:18,800
No, it is not true. I own some stock
in some of the hotels there...
but very little.

1095
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:24,800
I also have stock in IBM and IT&T.

1096
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:30,000
Do you have any interests or control
over gambling and narcotics...

1097
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:33,500
in the state of New York?
No, I do not.

1098
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:36,600
Senator, my client would like to
read a statement for this committee.

1099
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:40,400
Mr. Chairman,
I think this statement...

1100
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,600
is totally out of order
at this time.

1101
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:46,300
Sir, my client has answered every
question asked by this committee...

1102
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:48,100
with the utmost sincerity.

1103
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:51,000
He did not take the Fifth Amendment,
as it was his right to do...

1104
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:54,800
so in all fairness I think
the statement should be heard.

1105
02:17:55,800 --> 02:18:00,900
No, I'm going to allow Mr. Corleone
to read his statement.
I'll put it in the record.

1106
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:05,200
"In the hopes of clearing
my family name...

1107
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:07,800
and my sincere desire to give
my children their fair share...

1108
02:18:07,900 --> 02:18:12,200
of the American way of life
without a blemish...
on their name and background...

1109
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:14,300
I have appeared
before this committee...

1110
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:17,500
and given it all the cooperation
in my power.

1111
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:21,300
I consider it a great dishonor
to me personally...

1112
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:24,100
to have to deny
that I am a criminal.

1113
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:28,100
I wish to have the following
noted for the record:

1114
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:32,100
that I served my country faithfully
and honorably in World War Two...

1115
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:36,500
and was awarded a Navy Cross for
actions in defense of my country...

1116
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:42,200
that I have never been arrested or
indicted for any crime whatsoever...

1117
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:46,100
that no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy...

1118
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:48,800
whether it is called "Mafia,"
"Cosa Nostra"...

1119
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:53,200
or whatever other name
you wish to give...
has ever been made public.

1120
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:58,600
I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment...
although it is my right to do so.

1121
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:06,400
I challenge this committee...
to produce any witness
or evidence against me.

1122
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,800
And if they do not...

1123
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:12,400
I hope they will have the decency
to clear my name...

1124
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:16,500
with the same publicity with which
they now have besmirched it."

1125
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:20,000
I'm sure we're allquite impressed,
Mr. Corleone...

1126
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:22,500
particularly with your love
for our country.

1127
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:25,200
Committee will stand in recess
until 10:00 a. m. Monday morning...

1128
02:19:25,300 --> 02:19:27,100
at which time the committee
will produce a witness...

1129
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,800
who will corroborate the charges
which were made against you today...

1130
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:32,800
and at which time, Mr. Corleone,
you may very well be subject...

1131
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:35,000
to indictment for perjury.

1132
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,900
I remind you that
you're still under subpoena.
Adjourned.

1133
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,600
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1134
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:50,400
Ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth...
and I lose.

1135
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,500
You sound like my bookie.

1136
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:54,600
I owe that monkey my life.

1137
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:58,100
Well, just get
a good night's sleep.

1138
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:01,500
- Good night's sleep.
- Got a big day tomorrow.

1139
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:04,500
Got you a new suit,
a new shirt, new tie.

1140
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I'm gonna shave you myself
in the morning.

1141
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:13,600
You're gonna look respectable for
50 million of your fellow Americans.

1142
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:19,000
My life won't be worth a nickel
after tomorrow.

1143
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:22,400
Come on.
I saw this thing 19 times.

1144
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:26,200
You got a great home here, Frankie.

1145
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:30,000
The rest of your life, nobody gets
near you, you're not going anywhere.

1146
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:33,200
That's great.
Beautiful.

1147
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:35,200
Some deal I made.

1148
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:38,000
You'll live like a king.
You'll be a hero.

1149
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:41,000
You'll live better in here
than most people on the outside.

1150
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:43,800
Some deal.
Jesus.

1151
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:49,200
Alive.
Pentangeli is alive.

1152
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,000
- How'd they get their hands on him?
- Roth. He engineered it.

1153
02:20:56,700 --> 02:21:01,200
Frankie went to make a deal
with the Rosato brothers...
and they tried to kill him.

1154
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:03,700
He thought you double-crossed him.

1155
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:06,800
Our people with the New York
detective said he was halfdead...

1156
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:10,600
scared stiffand calling out loud
that you turned on him.

1157
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:15,300
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one...
and a lot more.

1158
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:19,100
The FBI has him airtight.

1159
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:22,000
He's on an army base,
24-hour guards.

1160
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:24,200
No way we can get to him.

1161
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:27,600
You've opened yourself
to five counts of perjury.

1162
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:32,100
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1163
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:34,800
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1164
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:39,400
Roth-- he played this one
beautifully.

1165
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:49,200
I want to talk to Fredo.

1166
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:29,500
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1167
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:33,800
We have time.

1168
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:36,700
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1169
02:22:38,300 --> 02:22:40,500
I didn't know all that much.

1170
02:22:41,300 --> 02:22:45,600
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1171
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:48,600
Anything you can tell me now?

1172
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:53,700
They got Pentangeli,
that's all I can tell you.

1173
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:10,400
I didn't know
it was gonna be a hit, Mike.

1174
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:14,100
I swear to God,
I didn't know it was gonna be a hit.

1175
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:19,900
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills...

1176
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,200
and he said
that he wanted to talk.

1177
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:28,700
He said that you and Roth...

1178
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:32,100
were in on a big deal together...

1179
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:38,400
and that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1180
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:42,200
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations.

1181
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:46,500
But if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast...

1182
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,400
it'd be good for the family.

1183
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:54,100
You believed that story?

1184
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:56,400
You believed that?

1185
02:23:56,500 --> 02:24:00,100
He said there was something in it
for me... on my own.

1186
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:02,600
I've always taken care of you.

1187
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,600
Taken care of me?

1188
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:09,200
You're my kid brother.
You take care of me?

1189
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:14,300
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1190
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:17,900
Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that.

1191
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,100
Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere.

1192
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:26,000
Send Fredo to pick somebody up
at the airport.

1193
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,200
I'm your older brother, Mike,
and I was stepped over!

1194
02:24:29,300 --> 02:24:33,900
- That's the way Pop wanted it.
- It ain't the way I wanted it!

1195
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,400
I can handle things!
I'm smart!

1196
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:40,300
Not like everybody says.
Like dumb. I'm smart...

1197
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,400
and I want respect!

1198
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,900
Is there anything you can tell me
about this investigation?
Anything more?

1199
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:06,600
The Senate lawyer, Questadt...

1200
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,300
he belongs to Roth.

1201
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:23,700
You're nothing to me now.

1202
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
You're not a brother,
you're not a friend.

1203
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:32,900
I don't wanna know you
or what you do.

1204
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:36,900
I don't wanna see you at the hotels.

1205
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,300
I don't want you near my house.

1206
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:46,200
When you see our mother,
I wanna know a day in advance...
so I won't be there.

1207
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:50,100
You understand?

1208
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:10,500
I don't want anything to happen
to him while my mother's alive.

1209
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,500
There are more people
than a ball game in here.

1210
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,400
There's Willi Cicci.

1211
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:27,100
This committee will come to order.

1212
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:31,900
- State your name, please.
- Frank Pentangeli.

1213
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:37,800
- And where were you born?
- Partanego. Outside of Palermo.
Where do you live now?

1214
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:42,100
I live in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.

1215
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:48,100
We have here, finally, a witness
that will further testify...

1216
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:50,800
to Michael Corleone's rule
over a criminal empire...

1217
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:54,300
that controls all of the gambling
in this country...
and perhaps in other countries.

1218
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:59,400
This witness had no buffer between
himself and Michael Corleone.

1219
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:02,900
He can corroborate ourcharges on
enough counts for this committee...

1220
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:07,200
to recommend a charge of perjury
against Michael Corleone.

1221
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:10,000
- Senator.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1222
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:11,900
Mr. Pentangeli.

1223
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:18,600
Were you a member
of the Corleone family?

1224
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:23,100
Did you serve under
caporegime Peter Clemenza...

1225
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:27,700
under Vito Corleone,
also known as the "Godfather"?

1226
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:35,900
I never knew no Godfather.

1227
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:40,800
I have my own family, Senator.

1228
02:28:44,100 --> 02:28:48,200
Mr. Pentangeli, you are
contradicting a sworn statement...

1229
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:50,100
you'd previously made to me
and signed.

1230
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:53,600
I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...

1231
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:58,100
were you at anytime
a memberof a crime organization...

1232
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:03,200
headed by Michael Corleone?
I don't know nothing about that.

1233
02:29:06,100 --> 02:29:09,900
I was in the olive oil business
with his father...

1234
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,900
but that was a long time ago,
that's all.

1235
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:15,500
We have a sworn affidavit.

1236
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:19,600
We have it--
your sworn affidavit...

1237
02:29:19,700 --> 02:29:24,300
that you murdered on
the orders of Michael Corleone.
Do you deny that confession?

1238
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:27,000
And do you realize what will happen
as a result of your denial?

1239
02:29:27,100 --> 02:29:30,100
Look, the FBI guys,
they promised me a deal...

1240
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:33,800
so I made up a lot of stuff
about Michael Corleone...

1241
02:29:33,900 --> 02:29:39,600
'cause that's what they wanted.
But it was all lies--
everything.

1242
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:42,800
And they kept saying...

1243
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:45,000
Michael Corleone did this...

1244
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,500
and that Michael Corleone did that.

1245
02:29:48,900 --> 02:29:52,800
So I said,"Yeah, sure!"

1246
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:56,400
Mr. Corleone, would you kindly
identify for the committee...

1247
02:29:56,400 --> 02:30:00,200
the gentleman sitting
to your left?
I can answer that.

1248
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:04,300
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1249
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:08,400
- Is he related to the witness?
- He is, I believe, his brother.

1250
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:10,800
Will he come forward
and be sworn, sir?

1251
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,500
Sir, this man
does not understand English.

1252
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:17,100
He came at his own expense to aid
his brother in this time of trouble.

1253
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:20,800
He's not under subpoena.
His reputation is impeccable.

1254
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:24,000
Are you saying he knows nothing
about these matters?
To my knowledge, nothing.

1255
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:27,000
I'm gonna find out
what the hell happened here.

1256
02:30:27,100 --> 02:30:29,000
Allright, this committee
is now adjourned.

1257
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:31,800
- The witness is excused.
- Senator!

1258
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:36,200
This committee owes an apology!

1259
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:40,000
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator.

1260
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:10,300
- Michael, excuse me.
- Hold on a minute.

1261
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:13,200
The children are outside.
We're going.

1262
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:19,700
What do you mean you're going?
We're all gonna leave tomorrow.

1263
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:24,100
I'll be in my room.

1264
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:30,200
Michael, I'm not going
back to Nevada.

1265
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:33,500
I brought the children
to say good-bye to you.

1266
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:38,900
I want you to know
I'm very happy for you.

1267
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,400
I suppose I always knew
you were too smart...

1268
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:44,000
to let any of them
ever beat you.

1269
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:49,400
- Why don't you sit down?
- I'm not going to stay long.

1270
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:53,000
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1271
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:56,300
Some things that have been
on my mind.

1272
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:01,000
- Changes I wanna make.
- I think it's too late for changes.

1273
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:07,800
I promised myself
I wasn't going to say anything.
You're too late.

1274
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:14,800
What really happened
with Pentangeli?

1275
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:25,200
His brother came, helped him.
I didn't even know
he had a brother.

1276
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:27,200
Where is he now?

1277
02:32:28,300 --> 02:32:30,600
He's on a plane back to Sicily.

1278
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:34,000
All he had to do
was show his face.

1279
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:40,000
It was between the brothers.
I had nothing to do with it.

1280
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:52,700
Nobody is going--
not you, not the kids! You hear me?

1281
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:57,000
You're my wife, they're my children.
I love you. I won't allow it.

1282
02:32:57,400 --> 02:33:01,100
You say you love me, then you
talk about allowing me to leave!

1283
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:04,200
Things have been going on for years
between men and women...

1284
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:06,100
- that will not change.
- You've become blind!

1285
02:33:06,200 --> 02:33:09,000
- Blind to what?
- Look what happened to us.

1286
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:12,000
- Look what's happened to our son!
- Nothing's happened--

1287
02:33:12,100 --> 02:33:15,100
- Anthony is fine!
- Anthony is not fine!

1288
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:19,600
- I don't wanna hear about it!
- You will!
Anthony's not fine!

1289
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:21,900
I don't wanna hear about it!

1290
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:23,600
Over!

1291
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:39,400
At this moment,
I feel no love for you at all.

1292
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:43,500
I never thought
that would ever happen...

1293
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:45,600
but it has.

1294
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,100
We're gonna leave tomorrow.

1295
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:11,400
Okay? Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?
You haven't heard me.

1296
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:15,500
What do you want from me?

1297
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:21,400
Do you expect me to let you go?
Do you expect me to let you take
my children from me?

1298
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:25,300
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1299
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:27,400
That that could never happen?

1300
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:31,800
That I'd use all my power to keep
something like that from happening?

1301
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:34,400
Don't you know that?

1302
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:43,600
Now, in time...

1303
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:45,800
you'll feel differently.

1304
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:49,300
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1305
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:53,300
I know that.

1306
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:58,300
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1307
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:02,300
Yes.

1308
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:04,700
I know what that meant to you.

1309
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:10,000
I'll make it up to you.

1310
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:12,500
I swear, I'll make it up to you.

1311
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,800
I'm gonna change.

1312
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,700
I'll change.

1313
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:22,100
I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

1314
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:26,400
And you'll forget about
this miscarriage...

1315
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:31,400
and we'll have another child...
and we'll go on--
you and I.

1316
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:34,700
We'll go on.

1317
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:40,200
You are blind.

1318
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:44,200
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1319
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:47,800
It was an abortion.

1320
02:35:49,300 --> 02:35:51,100
An abortion.

1321
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,800
Just like our marriage
is an abortion.

1322
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:58,300
Something that's unholy and evil.

1323
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:03,000
I didn't want your son!

1324
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:07,300
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1325
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:11,000
It was an abortion!

1326
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:16,600
It was a son! A son!
And I had it killed...
because this must all end!

1327
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:22,000
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.

1328
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:25,600
There would be no way...

1329
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:28,500
no way you could ever forgive me...

1330
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:30,900
not with this Sicilian thing...

1331
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:35,000
that's been going on
for 2,000 years--
Bitch!

1332
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:43,600
- You won't take my children.
- I will.

1333
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:47,500
- You won't take my children!
- They're my children too.

1334
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:17,100
Fredo, here's this for Grandma.

1335
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:28,100
What are you doing?

1336
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:27,400
Michael, say good-bye.

1337
02:44:41,700 --> 02:44:44,300
Can I speak with you
for a second?

1338
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:56,000
- Where's Mike?
- Waiting foryou to leave.

1339
02:44:59,400 --> 02:45:01,300
Can I talk with him?

1340
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:03,200
Sorry, no chance.

1341
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:07,000
- Can I see him?
- He's in the boathouse.

1342
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:21,800
Michael, it's Connie.

1343
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,600
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1344
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,300
Is Kay coming?

1345
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:15,200
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1346
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:19,100
He asked for you,
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1347
02:46:22,300 --> 02:46:24,200
That's right.

1348
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:29,900
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1349
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,200
Please, I wanna talk to you.

1350
02:46:47,400 --> 02:46:50,700
I hated you for so many years.

1351
02:46:50,800 --> 02:46:54,700
I think that I did things to myself,
to hurt myself...

1352
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:56,600
so that you'd know...

1353
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:01,500
that I could hurt you.

1354
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:11,400
You were just being strong
for all of us the way Papa was.

1355
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:14,200
And I forgive you.

1356
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:21,200
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1357
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:26,000
He's so sweet
and helpless without you.

1358
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:35,300
You need me.
I want to take care ofyou now.

1359
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,400
Sit down.

1360
02:49:38,300 --> 02:49:42,200
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1361
02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:45,200
You hear about it?

1362
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:47,400
I hear that he's in Israel.

1363
02:49:48,200 --> 02:49:52,700
And the High Court in Israel
turned down his request...
to live there as a returned Jew.

1364
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:56,700
His passport's been invalidated,
except for return to the US.

1365
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:59,100
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1366
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:03,400
He offered a gift of a million
dollars if they let him live there.

1367
02:50:03,900 --> 02:50:05,700
They turned him down.

1368
02:50:05,800 --> 02:50:09,900
- He's gonna try Panama.
- Panama won't take him.

1369
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,400
Not for a million,
not for ten million.

1370
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:14,300
His medical condition
is reported as terminal.

1371
02:50:14,400 --> 02:50:17,200
He's only gonna live
another six months anyway.

1372
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:20,300
He's been dying of
the same heart attack for 20 years.

1373
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:25,300
- That plane goes to Miami.
- Right. That's where I want it met.

1374
02:50:25,400 --> 02:50:28,500
Mike, that's impossible.
They'll turn him over directly...

1375
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:30,700
to the Internal Revenue, Customs
and half the FBl.

1376
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:33,900
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1377
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,300
It would be like trying to kill
the president. No way to get to him.

1378
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:39,700
You know, you surprise me.

1379
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:46,000
If anything in this life
is certain--

1380
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:48,600
if history's taught us anything...

1381
02:50:49,100 --> 02:50:51,600
it's that you can kill anyone.

1382
02:50:58,700 --> 02:51:01,600
Difficult, not impossible.

1383
02:51:01,700 --> 02:51:03,900
Good.

1384
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:09,700
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1385
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:16,400
I thought you were
gonna tell me that...

1386
02:51:16,500 --> 02:51:19,200
you were moving
your family to Vegas.

1387
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:25,400
And that you'd been offered the
vice presidency of the hotels there.

1388
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:27,500
- I thought you'd tell me that.
- I turned them down.

1389
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:31,300
Do I have to tell you
about every offer that I turn down?

1390
02:51:34,200 --> 02:51:37,700
Let's do business.
All right.

1391
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:41,400
Just consider this.
Just consider it.

1392
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:44,300
Now, Roth and the Rosatos
are on the run.

1393
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:47,200
Are they worth it,
and are they strong enough?

1394
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:51,000
Is it worth it?
I mean, you won.

1395
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:52,900
Do you want to wipe
everybody out?

1396
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:56,000
I don't feel I have to wipe
everybody out--

1397
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:59,000
just my enemies, that's all.

1398
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:09,200
You gonna come along with me on
these things I have to do or what?

1399
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:14,200
'Cause if not, you can take your
wife, family and your mistress...

1400
02:52:14,300 --> 02:52:16,600
move them all to Las Vegas.

1401
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:25,700
Why do you hurt me? I've always been
loyal to you. I mean, what is this?

1402
02:52:38,900 --> 02:52:41,400
What is it that you want me to do?

1403
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:47,800
How would you like it if I taught
you how to catch really big fish?

1404
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,600
- Would you like that?
- Okay.

1405
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:53,500
You know, when I was your age...

1406
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:56,800
I went out fishing
with all my brothers...

1407
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,200
and my father...

1408
02:52:59,400 --> 02:53:01,300
everybody...

1409
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:04,400
and I was the only one
that caught a fish.

1410
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:09,800
Nobody else could catch one,
except me.
You know how I did it?

1411
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:14,700
Every time I put the line
in the water, I said a Hail Mary.

1412
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:18,200
And every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1413
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:23,200
You believe that?
It's true.

1414
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:25,100
That's the secret.

1415
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:29,300
Wanna try it
when we go on the lake?

1416
02:53:29,400 --> 02:53:33,400
Okay.
What else you got?

1417
02:53:58,900 --> 02:54:01,400
Things are gonna be okay, Frankie.
Don't worry.

1418
02:54:01,500 --> 02:54:05,200
- Did my brother go back?
- Yeah. Don't worry.

1419
02:54:05,400 --> 02:54:11,100
He's ten times tougher than me--
my brother.
He's old-fashioned.

1420
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:14,200
He didn't wanna go out to dinner.
He just wanted to go straight home.

1421
02:54:14,300 --> 02:54:16,200
That's my brother.
There's nothing...

1422
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:19,200
that could get him away
from that two-meal town.

1423
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:22,900
He could've been big here,
could've had his own family.

1424
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:32,400
What do I do now?

1425
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:43,600
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1426
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:48,800
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1427
02:54:48,800 --> 02:54:52,100
I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1428
02:54:54,900 --> 02:54:57,300
You were around the old-timers...

1429
02:54:57,300 --> 02:55:00,400
agreeing about how the family's
should be organized...

1430
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:05,700
based on the old home allegiance
and called them regimes--
capos and soldiers.

1431
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:08,700
And it worked.

1432
02:55:08,800 --> 02:55:11,200
Yeah, it worked.

1433
02:55:11,300 --> 02:55:14,800
Those were the great old days,
you know?

1434
02:55:14,900 --> 02:55:17,800
And we was like the Roman Empire.

1435
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:21,200
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1436
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:27,400
It was once.

1437
02:55:43,800 --> 02:55:48,200
When a plot
against the emperor failed...

1438
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:51,400
the plotters were always given
a chance...

1439
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:56,400
to let the families
keep their fortunes.

1440
02:55:56,900 --> 02:55:59,100
Yeah, but only the rich guys.

1441
02:55:59,100 --> 02:56:01,200
The little guys,
they got knocked off...

1442
02:56:01,300 --> 02:56:03,900
and all their estates
went to the emperors...

1443
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:08,800
unless they went home
and killed themselves.
Then nothing happened to them.

1444
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:14,000
And their families
were taken care of.

1445
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:19,600
That was a good break.
Nice deal.

1446
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:21,000
Yeah.

1447
02:56:22,100 --> 02:56:23,900
They went home...

1448
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:28,200
and sat in a hot bath...

1449
02:56:28,300 --> 02:56:30,700
opened up their veins...

1450
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:33,100
and bled to death.

1451
02:56:34,600 --> 02:56:38,300
And sometimes they had
a little party before they did it.

1452
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:46,100
Don't worry about anything.

1453
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:49,900
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1454
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:09,400
See you, Tom.

1455
02:57:22,400 --> 02:57:25,000
You have to go.

1456
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:29,100
- So pretty.
- Please hurry. He's coming.

1457
02:57:31,300 --> 02:57:34,100
Go rest.

1458
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,900
Kiss Mama good-bye.

1459
02:57:44,500 --> 02:57:48,500
Will you kiss your mother good-bye?
Say good-bye to Mama.

1460
02:57:49,900 --> 02:57:51,700
I love you.

1461
02:57:53,400 --> 02:57:54,800
Please.

1462
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,500
Come here.

1463
02:58:23,900 --> 02:58:25,800
Please, kiss me once.

1464
03:00:01,500 --> 03:00:03,500
Easy.

1465
03:00:11,900 --> 03:00:14,600
He's here!
We're going fishing!

1466
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:19,300
Michael wants to take him
to Reno now!
Oh, shit.

1467
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:24,500
Okay, kid, you gotta go to Reno
with your pop.

1468
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:29,700
Come on, I'll take you
fishing tomorrow, okay?
Okay.

1469
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,400
Attaboy.
Hey, Anthony.

1470
03:00:34,500 --> 03:00:38,800
Listen. I'll catch one for you
in secret, huh? All right?

1471
03:00:38,900 --> 03:00:40,700
Okay, go ahead.

1472
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:43,100
Okay, let's go.

1473
03:01:21,300 --> 03:01:25,500
Mr. Roth, you understand
I'll have to take you into custody?
Yes, I understand.

1474
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:28,400
Can you give us your reaction to
the High Court of Israel's ruling?

1475
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:31,400
I'm a retired investor
on a pension.

1476
03:01:31,400 --> 03:01:36,500
I went to Israel because I wished
to live there as Jew...
in the twilight of my life.

1477
03:01:42,400 --> 03:01:45,800
Hey, Frankie, come on out!
Let's play some hearts!

1478
03:02:10,300 --> 03:02:13,000
Is it true you're worth
over $300 million, Mr. Roth?

1479
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:16,900
I'm a retired investor
living on a pension.

1480
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:20,500
I came home to vote
in the presidential election...

1481
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:23,900
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1482
03:02:35,700 --> 03:02:38,000
Jesus Christ.

1483
03:02:38,200 --> 03:02:42,100
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1484
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:44,800
the Lord is with thee.

1485
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:48,100
Blessed are thou amongst women.

1486
03:02:48,200 --> 03:02:51,100
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

1487
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:56,200
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1488
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:40,000
Hey, everybody,
come on, pay attention. Come here.

1489
03:03:40,100 --> 03:03:43,100
This is my friend, Carlo Rizzi.
My brother, Fredo.

1490
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:44,900
- You know Fredo.
- Sure.

1491
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:49,500
Here's my stepbrother, Tom.
That's his girl, Theresa.

1492
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:52,700
This cute little thing over here's
my sister Connie I told you about.

1493
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:57,300
Come on, say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, ain't he?
Yes.

1494
03:03:57,400 --> 03:03:59,900
Oh, that droopy thing over there,
that's my brother, Mike.

1495
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,600
We call him Joe Collar, you know
what I mean? Go on, sit down.

1496
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:05,800
- Go ahead. Talk to each other.
- Sit down.

1497
03:04:05,900 --> 03:04:07,700
Hey, Mr. Einstein.

1498
03:04:10,900 --> 03:04:13,700
- Here's the cake.
- Hey, get in here.

1499
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:19,000
- Where's your father?
- On a wild goose chase.

1500
03:04:19,100 --> 03:04:21,500
- Here.
- Let's see that thing.

1501
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:25,300
- Oh, honey, that's nice.
- That's beautiful.

1502
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:30,000
- Should I put the candles on now?
- Go on. You help her, all right?
Sure.

1503
03:04:30,400 --> 03:04:32,900
- What is that, rum?
- Yeah.

1504
03:04:38,300 --> 03:04:42,100
Sonny, come on, don't touch
the antipasto till Pop sees it.

1505
03:04:49,200 --> 03:04:52,500
What do you think, the nerve of them
Japs, them slanty-eyed bastards?

1506
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:54,800
Dropping bombs on our own backyard.
On Pop's birthday, you know?

1507
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:58,200
They didn't know
it was Pop's birthday.

1508
03:04:58,300 --> 03:05:00,900
Well, we should've expected it
after the oil embargo.

1509
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,500
What do you mean, expected it?
They got no right dropping bombs.

1510
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:05,700
What are you, a Jap lover?
You on their side?

1511
03:05:05,800 --> 03:05:07,700
I understand 30,000 men enlisted
this morning.

1512
03:05:07,800 --> 03:05:10,400
- Bunch of saps.
- Why are they saps?

1513
03:05:10,400 --> 03:05:15,100
Come on, do we even have to talk
about the war?
You talk to Carlo, all right?

1514
03:05:16,700 --> 03:05:20,600
They're saps because
they risk their lives for strangers.

1515
03:05:20,700 --> 03:05:24,400
- That's Pop talking.
- You're goddamn right.

1516
03:05:24,400 --> 03:05:25,900
They risk their lives
for their country.

1517
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:27,600
Country ain't your blood.
You remember that.

1518
03:05:27,700 --> 03:05:29,900
- I don't feel that way.
- "I don't feel that way."

1519
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:34,800
If you don't feel like that,
quit college and join the army.
I did.

1520
03:05:35,900 --> 03:05:38,000
I enlisted in the Marines.

1521
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:44,200
- Mike, why didn't you come to us?
- What do you mean?

1522
03:05:44,300 --> 03:05:48,400
Pop had to pull a lot of strings
to get you a deferment.
I didn't ask for it.

1523
03:05:48,500 --> 03:05:51,700
I didn't ask for a deferment.
I didn't want it.

1524
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:54,600
Come on, knock it off! Come on!

1525
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:56,600
Punk.

1526
03:05:56,800 --> 03:05:58,700
- Go on.
- Sit down.

1527
03:06:01,100 --> 03:06:04,200
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1528
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:09,700
Go show Carlo the tree.

1529
03:06:19,900 --> 03:06:21,200
Nice.

1530
03:06:25,600 --> 03:06:28,600
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1531
03:06:29,100 --> 03:06:31,700
That's swell. Congratulations.

1532
03:06:31,800 --> 03:06:35,300
That's right, encourage him.
Go on, get me a drink.

1533
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:38,200
Go on.

1534
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:43,700
I don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1535
03:06:43,800 --> 03:06:47,800
Many times, he and I have talked
about your future.

1536
03:06:49,600 --> 03:06:52,500
You talked to my father
about my future?

1537
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:58,200
- My future?
- He has high hopes for you.

1538
03:06:58,300 --> 03:07:00,900
I have my own plans
for my future.

1539
03:07:01,300 --> 03:07:06,100
Did you go to college to get stupid?
You're really stupid.
He's here, come on!

1540
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,100
Come on.

1541
03:07:11,900 --> 03:07:13,300
Stupid.

1542
03:07:29,600 --> 03:07:33,100
Surprise!

1543
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:37,300
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1544
03:07:37,400 --> 03:07:40,800
For he's a jolly good fellow

1545
03:07:40,900 --> 03:07:42,900
Which nobody can deny
