00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,882
Ass!

4
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,883
I just...

5
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,250
I was told...

6
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,488
Have you seen...
I was told that if...

7
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,259
I was late again
I'd be summarily dismissed.

Hello, Peter. What's happening?

18
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,657
We have sort of a problem here.

19
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,825
Yeah. You apparently didn't put

20
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,926
one of the new cover sheets
on your T.P.S. Reports.

21
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,202
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.
I forgot.

22
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,242
Yeah.

23
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,106
You see,
we're putting cover sheets

24
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,146
on all T.P.S. Reports now
before they go out.

25
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,614
Did you see the memo about this?

26
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,084
Yeah. I have the memo right here.

27
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,745
I just forgot...

28
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:53,258
but, it's not shipping out
till tomorrow so there's no problem.

29
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,190
Yeah.

30
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,924
If you could make sure you do
that from now on, that'd be great.

31
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,468
And I'll make sure you get another copy
of that memo, okay?

32
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,369
No. I have the memo. It's right...

33
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,272
<i>Hello, Phil. What's happening?</i>

34
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,910
<i>I came by here yesterday...</i>

35
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,644

36
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,707

37
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,942
Milton?

38
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,378
Hi.

39
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,880
Could you turn that down a bit?

40
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,186
But I was told
that I could listen...

41
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,819
to the radio at a reasonable
volume from 9:00 to 11:00...

42
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,693
Yeah. I know you're allowed to.

43
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,033
I was just thinking
maybe like a personal favor.

44
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,901
Well, I told Bill
if Sandra's going to...

45
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,202
listen to her headphones
while she's filing...

46
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,267
then I should be able to listen
to the radio while I'm collating...

47
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,905
so I don't see why I should have
to turn down the radio.

48
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,503
All right.

49
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,981
I enjoy listening
at a reasonable volume...

50
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,948
Thanks.

51
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,383
From 9:00 to 11:00...

52
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,846
Hi, Peter.

53
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,750
What's happening?

54
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,417
We need to talk
about your T.P.S. Reports.

55
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,926
Yeah. The cover sheet. I know.

56
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,052
Bill talked to me about it.

57
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,563
Yeah. Did you get that memo?

58
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,293
Yeah, I got the memo,
and I understand the policy...

59
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,268
and the problem is just
that I forgot for one time...

60
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,827
and I've already taken care of it

61
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,635
so it's not even really
a problem anymore.

62
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,198
Yeah.

63
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,542
We're putting new cover sheets
on all the T.P.S. Reports now...

64
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:25,482
so if you could try to remember
to do that from now on,

65
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,643
that'd be great.

66
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,913
All right!

Peter Gibbons.

70
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,631
Yes.

71
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,398
I have the memo.

72
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,242
No. Not again. L...

73
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,039
Why does it say paper jam
when there is none?

74
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,875
I swear to God,
one of these days

75
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,745
I just kick this piece of shit
out the window.

76
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,614
You and me both, man.

77
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,381
That thing's lucky I'm not armed.

78
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,182
Piece of shit.

79
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,350

00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,721

00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,630
No. Thanks.

83
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,063
Please.

84
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,261
"Michael Bolton"?

85
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,564
That's me.

86
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,697
Wow! Is that your real name?

87
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,797
Yeah.

88
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,042
So are you related to that singer?

89
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,739
No. It's just a coincidence.

90
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,517
No one in this country
can pronounce my name right.

91
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,420
It's not that hard.
"Na-ee" and "anajaad." Nayanajaad.

92
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,323
At least your name
isn't Michael Bolton.

93
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,327
You know, there's
nothing wrong with that name.

94
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,386
There was nothing wrong with it...

95
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,829
until I was 12...

96
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:51,097
and that no-talent ass-clown became
famous and started winning Grammys.

97
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,936
Well, why don't you just go
by Mike instead of Michael?

98
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,100
No way. Why should I change?
He's the one who sucks.

99
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,937
Hey, guys.

100
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,103
What's up, G?

101
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,738
Want to go to Chotchkie's,
get some coffee?

102
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,873
It's early.

103
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,942
I gotta get out of here.
I think I'm gonna lose it.

104
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,182
Sounds like somebody
has a case of the Mondays.

105
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,387
Boy, I tell ya, some days.

106
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,495
One of these days,
it's gonna be like...

107
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,534
Can I get you something more to drink
or maybe something to nibble on?

108
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,007
Pizza shooters, shrimp poppers,
or extreme fajitas?

109
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,634
- Just coffee.
- Okay!

110
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,145
Sounds like a case of the Mondays.

111
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,919
What if we're...
still doing this when we're 50?

112
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,388
It'd be nice to have
that kind of job security.

113
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,723
Lumbergh's gonna have me work
on Saturday. I can tell already.

114
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,491
I'm gonna end up doing it,
because I'm a big pussy...

115
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,533
which is why I work at Initech
to begin with.

116
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,093
I work at Initech and I don't
consider myself a pussy, okay?

117
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,002
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

118
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,540
In fact, they're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

119
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,201
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

120
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,436
That's right.

121
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,245
They don't understand.

122
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,782
I could program a virus
that'd rip that place off big time.

123
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,874
Yeah.

124
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,784
Big time.

125
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,046
There she is.

126
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,760
You always talk about this girl.

127
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,590
You're so obsessed with her,
why don't you ask her out?

128
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,031
I can't do that.
I'd be another asshole customer.

129
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,001
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

130
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,698
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

131
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,833
That reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

132
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,069
Why not?

133
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:42,046
I'm going to see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

134
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,878
Dude, an occupational hypnotherapist?

135
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,885
I know. Anne wants me to go.

136
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,114
She thinks it might help.

137
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,423
You know,
sometimes I think that...

138
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,552
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

139
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,961
- I know what you mean.
- Yeah.

140
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,857
What is that supposed to mean?

141
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,027
Nothing.

142
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,636
Why don't you tell Anne
you're not into hypnosis...

143
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,072
and want to play poker with us?

144
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,335
She'll get pissed off.

145
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,402
Besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

146
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,880
He did help Anne lose weight.

147
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,676
Peter, she's anorexic.

148
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,241
Yeah, I know.

149
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,310
The guy's really good.

150
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,519
Well, I don't think
any occupational hypnotherapist...

151
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,923
will help you solve
any of your problems.

152
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,427
And speaking of problems...

153
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,896
what's this I hear about you having
problems with your T.P.S. Reports?

154
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,467
Didn't you get that memo?

155
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,602
Hey, guys! Peter!

156
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,161
Is that Smykowski?

157
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,373
- Samir!
- What's he doing?

158
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,238
Probably working on
another heart attack.

159
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,301
I've been looking all over
for you guys!

160
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,779
Have you seen this? I knew it.

161
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,372
It's a staff meeting. So what?

162
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,247
So what? We're all screwed.
That's what.

163
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,876
They're gonna downsize Initech.

164
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,047
What are you talking about?
How do you know that?

165
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,286
They're bringing in a consultant.
That's how I know.

166
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,350
That's what this staff meeting
is all about.

167
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,362
It happened at Initrode last year.

168
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,159
You have to interview
with this consultant.

169
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,790
They call them efficiency experts

170
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,700
but you're really interviewing
for your own job.

171
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,170
Every week you think
you'll lose your job and you're still here.

172
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,764
Not this time.
I bet I'm the first one laid off.

173
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,968
Just to think of going to
the state unemployment office

174
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,944
and stand in line
with those scumbags!

175
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,479
Shit.

176
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:27,013
Did you know there are people in this world
that don't have to tolerate this shit?

177
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,520
Like that inventor of the pet rock.

178
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,689
You see,
that's what you have to do.

179
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,253
You have to use your mind...

180
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,693
and come up with
a great idea like that.

181
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,890
You can make millions,
never have to work again.

182
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,365
You think the pet rock
was a great idea?

183
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,902
Sure it was.

184
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,563
The guy made a million dollars.

185
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,609
I had an idea like that once...

186
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,110
a long time ago.

187
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,805
Really? What was it?

188
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,250
Well, all right.

189
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:02,310
It was a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

190
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,257
You see, it would be this mat...

191
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,452
that you would put on the floor...

192
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:13,191
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

193
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,199
that you could jump to.

194
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,905
That's the worst idea I've ever heard.

195
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,308
Yes, it's horrible, this idea.

196
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,678
Look, I gotta get out of here.

197
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,709
I'll see you guys later,
if I still have a job.

198
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,927
Our high school guidance counselor used
to ask us what we'd do with $1 million.

199
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,328
Whatever you said
was supposed to be your career.

200
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,731
If you wanted to fix old cars
then you should be an auto mechanic.

201
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,894
What did you say?

202
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,530
I never had an answer.

203
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,574
I guess that's
why I'm working at Initech.

204
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,077
No, you work here 'cause
that's a bullshit question.

205
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,976
If everyone listened to her
there'd be no janitors

206
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,241
because no millionaire
would clean up shit.

207
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,045
You know what I would do
if I had $1 million?

208
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,212
I'd invest half
in low-risk mutual funds

209
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,384
then take the other half to my friend
who works in securities...

210
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,051
You're missing the point.

211
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:19,621
It's designed to help you figure out
what you would want to do if...

212
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,863
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

213
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,749
Hey, Peter, man! Check out Channel 9!

214
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,260
Check out this chick!

215
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,890
Damn it! Can't you pretend we can't hear
each other through the wall?

216
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,161
Sorry! Anne over there?

217
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,395
No, but...

218
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,967
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

219
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,336
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

220
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,239
<i>The key is early detection.</i>

221
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,248
<i>Tumors detected early...</i>

222
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,446
Jeez, Lawrence.

223
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,248
Sorry, I thought you'd want to see it.

224
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,293
- Doesn't she look like Anne?
- Yeah.

225
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,724
A little bit.

226
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,091
She hasn't been here in a while.
You still dating?

227
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,757
Yeah.

228
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,300
I guess. I don't know.

229
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,700
Sometimes I think
she's cheating on me.

230
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,931
Yeah. I get that feeling, too.

231
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,933
What do you mean by that?

232
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,903
I don't know, man.

233
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,635
I get that feeling lookin' at her...

234
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,172
like she's the type of chick that'd just...

235
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,249
I'm sorry, man. Look, I...

236
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,382
I'm talking out of my ass.

237
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,427
Forget it. It's all right.

238
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,959
I had a rough day.

239
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,393
Tell me about it.

240
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,625
I gotta wake my ass up

241
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,727
at 6 a.m. Every day this week.

242
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,938
Drag up to Las Golindas.

243
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,201
I'm doing the drywall
at the new McDonald's.

244
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,268
Let me ask you something.

245
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,405
When you come in on Monday,
feeling down, does anyone say

246
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,214
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

247
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,284
No.

248
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,550
No, man.

249
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,691
Shit, no, man.

250
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,218
You'd get your ass kicked, saying that.

251
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,156
We going fishing this weekend?

252
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,225
No, Lumbergh is gonna
make me work. I know it.

253
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,602
- You can get out of that easily.
- Yeah? How?

254
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,264
When a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

255
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,540
he generally asks
at the end of the day, right?

256
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,477
Yeah.

257
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,243
All you gotta do is avoid him...
That's all right, I got it.

258
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,878
On the last few hours on Friday,
duck out early...

259
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,754
turn off your answering machine,
you're home free.

260
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,288
That's a really good idea.

261
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,324
Fuckin' "A," man.

262
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,933
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had $1 million?

263
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,902
I'll tell you what I'd do.

264
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,266
Two chicks at the same time, man.

265
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,170
That's it?

266
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,578
If you had $1 million,
you'd do two chicks at the same time?

267
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,676
Damn straight.
I've always wanted to do that.

268
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:32,281
If I were rich, I could hook that up
'cause chicks dig dudes with money.

269
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,586
Not all chicks.

270
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,355
The type of chicks
that would do that do.

271
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,554
Good point.

272
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,661
What would you do?

273
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,027
Besides two chicks?

274
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,293
Well, yeah.

275
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,959
Nothing.

276
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,031
Nothing, huh?

277
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,297
I would relax.

278
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,535
I would sit on my ass all day.

279
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,803
I would do nothing.

280
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,638
You don't need
$1 million to do that.

281
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,239
Look at my cousin.

282
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,410
He's broke, don't do shit.

283
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,015
<i>Corporate accounts payable.</i>
<i>Nina speaking.</i>

284
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,422
<i>Just a moment.</i>

285
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,018
<i>Corporate accounts payable.</i>
<i>Nina speaking.</i>

286
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,858
<i>Just a moment.</i>

287
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,421
<i>Corporate accounts payable.</i>
<i>Nina speaking.</i>

288
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,092
<i>Just a moment.</i>

289
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:21,637
You should ask yourself
with every decision you make

290
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,141
"Is this good for the company?"
"Am I helping..."

291
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,700
Is that the guy?

292
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,940
Yeah. We're screwed.

293
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,106
Okay, then...

294
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,146
I'd like to go ahead and welcome

295
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,518
a new member to our team here.

296
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,989
This is...

297
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,549
Bob Slydell.

298
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,290
Yeah.

299
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,592
Bob is a consultant.

300
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,760
Yeah. He's gonna be sort of...

301
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,534
helping us out a little here...

302
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,474
asking questions,
seeing if there are ways...

303
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,742
we can make things run
a little more smoothly around here.

304
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,015
Yeah.

305
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,175
And remember, next Friday...

306
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,084
is Hawaiian shirt day.

307
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,558
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and...

308
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,959
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

309
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,258
I said I don't care
if they lay me off.

310
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:25,167
Because I told Bill
if they move my desk one more time

311
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,899
then I'm quitting,
I'm going to quit.

312
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,440
And I told Dom, too

313
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,069
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year

314
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,976
and I used to be by the window

315
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,608
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married.

316
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,279
Then they switched from the Swingline,
to the Boston stapler...

317
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,152
but I kept my Swingline
because it works better

318
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,715
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline.

319
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:48,793
Okay, Milton.

320
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,091
<i>No, it's not okay,</i>
<i>because if they make me,</i>

321
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,564
<i>if they take my stapler,</i>
<i>then I'll...</i>

322
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,897
<i>I'll set the building on fire.</i>

323
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,233
Okay, well, that sounds great.

324
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,268
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

325
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,412
Goodbye.

326
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,279
Come on.

327
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,412
Oh, for cryin'...

328
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,768
Hello, Peter.
What's happening?

329
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,411
I'm gonna need you

330
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,278
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow

331
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:24,084
so if you could be here
around 9:00, that would be great.

332
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,856
Okay?

333
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,319
Oh, and I almost forgot.

334
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,760
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in

335
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,392
on Sunday, too, okay?

336
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,100
We...

337
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,967
lost some people this week...

338
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,097
and...

339
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,404
we need to sort of play catch-up.

340
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,500
Thanks.

341
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,642
<i>So I was sitting in my cubicle today</i>
<i>and I realized,</i>

342
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,219
ever since I started working...

343
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,480
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

344
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,423
the day before it.

345
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:06,162
So that means that every single day
that you see me...

346
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,897
that's on the worst day of my life.

347
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,731
What about today?
Is today the worst day of your life?

348
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,431
- Yeah.
- Wow, that's messed up.

349
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,807
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,138
Go on.

351
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:24,046
Is there any way
that you could sort of

352
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,880
just zonk me out so that
I don't know

353
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,113
that I'm at work...
in here?

354
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:34,418
Could I come home and think that
I've been fishing all day or something?

355
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:38,190
That's really not what I do, Peter.

356
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,094
However...

357
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,662
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

358
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,267
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

359
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,631
I want you to try and relax.

360
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,604
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body

361
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:01,415
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

362
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,452
Now I want you to relax your legs.

363
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:11,155
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy

364
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,629
as you slip deeper and deeper

365
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,634
into a state
of complete relaxation.

366
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,866
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

367
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,939
Deeper and deeper.

368
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,474
Way down.

369
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,410
Your concern about your job...

370
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,741
melts away...

371
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,738
way...

372
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,680
way down.

373
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,814
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

374
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,655
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

375
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,425
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

376
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,467
and you will remain in that state...

377
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,895
until I snap my fingers.

378
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,428
Three.

379
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,237
Deeper and deeper.

380
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,968
Way...

381
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,506
way down.

382
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,502
Two.

383
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,613
Deeper and deeper...

384
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,580
Way down...

385
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,215
One.

386
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,654
Oh, my God!
Dr. Swanson!

387
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,221
- Is he breathing?
- Call 911!

388
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,131
Oh! Where's the phone?
Where's the goddamn phone?!

389
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,332
<i>Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh.</i>

390
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,531
<i>It's about...</i>

391
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,369
<i>10 o'clock.</i>

392
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,875
<i>Yeah. Just...</i>

393
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,407
<i>wondering where you are.</i>

394
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,110
<i>Yeah. Hi.</i>
<i>It's Bill Lumbergh again.</i>

395
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,710
<i>I just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>you knew</i>

396
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:19,780
<i>that we did start at the</i>
<i>usual time this morning.</i>

397
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,055
<i>Yeah. It isn't a half day</i>
<i>or anything like that...</i>

398
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,119
<i>so if you could just go ahead</i>

399
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,461
<i>and get here as soon as possible...</i>

400
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,796
<i>that would be terrific.</i>

401
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,882
<i>Yeah. Hi.</i>
<i>It's Bill Lum...</i>

402
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,224
<i>Yeah. It's...</i>
<i>Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumber...</i>

403
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,089
<i>Yeah. It's me again.</i>

404
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,027
<i>I was away from my desk</i>
<i>for a minute.</i>

405
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,225
<i>Just checking in case you called</i>
<i>while I was gone.</i>

406
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,527
Hello?

407
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,298
<i>Peter, what's going on?</i>

408
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,535
Huh?

409
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,666
<i>It's 3:30 p.m.</i>
<i>Why aren't you at work?</i>

410
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,035
Because I...

411
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,874
I didn't feel like it.

412
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,708
<i>Peter, what's gotten into you?</i>

413
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,272
<i>First, you just sit there</i>
<i>while Dr. Swanson dies,</i>

414
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,184
<i>then you walk out of the car and</i>
<i>embarrass me in front of my friends.</i>

415
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,482
<i>And don't blame this on hypnosis.</i>

416
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,045
<i>That's total bull...</i>

417
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,522
<i>Listen, asshole.</i>
<i>Nobody hangs up on me.</i>

418
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,065
<i>We're through.</i>

419
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,067
<i>Oh, and one more thing...</i>

420
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,296
<i>I've been cheating on you!</i>

421
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,173
So, from now on,
only use the new time sheets...

422
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:51,739
if you've worked on two or more
job codes in one day

423
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,808
and you need the extra columns
to fit it all in.

424
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,444
Otherwise, use the old...

425
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:59,649
Where's Peter?
I heard he didn't show up this weekend.

426
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,748
I don't know.

427
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,417
...that could really help us out.

428
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,518
Who's that guy?

429
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,192
So, any questions?

430
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,412
Hi. I'm Peter.

431
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,572
Hi. Can I help you?

432
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,548
What are you doin' for lunch today?

433
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,780
Well, our specials today
are blackened chicken.

434
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,345
It's actually right there
on the board. Excuse me.

435
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,223
Hey, look who's back!

436
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,022
Table for three to...

437
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,792
I was asking what
you were doing for lunch.

438
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,460
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

439
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,298
Are you serious?

440
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,527
Yeah.

441
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,801
Yeah. I don't think
I'm supposed to do that.

442
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,072
Okay, well, I'll tell you what I'll do.

443
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,704
I'm gonna go next door
and get a table

444
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,373
and if you'd like to join me...

445
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,712
no big deal, all right?

446
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,308
And if not, that's cool, too.

447
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,614
- Okay?
- Okay.

448
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:03,847
All right.

449
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:08,656
When you say "next door,"
do you mean Chili's or Flinger's?

450
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,058
Flinger's.

451
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,488
Okay.

452
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,996
What you do at Initech

453
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,433
is you take the specifications
from the customers

454
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,403
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

455
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,702
Yes. That's right.

456
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,435
Well, then I just have to ask...

457
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,438
why couldn't the customers just

458
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,344
take them directly
to the software people, huh?

459
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,078
Well, I'll tell you why.

460
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,374
Uh, because...

461
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,751
engineers are not good
at dealing with customers.

462
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,490
So...

463
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:45,191
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

464
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,359
Well...

465
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:53,236
No... My secretary does that,
or they're faxed.

466
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:57,066
So then you must physically
bring them to the software people.

467
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,700
Well...

468
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,872
No.

469
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,175
I mean... sometimes.

470
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:08,042
What would you say
you do here?

471
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,212
Well, look,
I already told you.

472
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,382
I deal with the goddamn customers

473
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,585
so the engineers don't have to.

474
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,252
I have people skills.

475
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,091
I am good at dealing with people!

476
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,529
Can't you understand that?

477
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,123
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

478
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,638
Let's see...

479
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,372
You are...

480
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,743
Michael...

481
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,878
- Bolton?
- Yeah.

482
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,151
Is that your real name?

483
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,381
Yeah.

484
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,489
Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

485
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,226
No, it's just a coincidence.

486
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,890
I'll be honest with you,
I love his music.

487
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,126
- I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
- Me, too.

488
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,862
I don't know
if it gets any better

489
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,404
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

490
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,270
But you must really
love his music, huh?

491
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,574
Yeah, he's...

492
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,339
he's pretty good, I guess.

493
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,971
You're goddamn right, he is.

494
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,710
So tell me,
what's your favorite song of his?

495
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,216
I don't know.

496
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,693
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

497
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,829
That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

498
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,663
But it must be twice as hard for you
being you have the same name.

499
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,636
I celebrate the guy's
entire catalogue.

500
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,196
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

501
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,575
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

502
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,577
Hi.

503
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,311
Hey.

504
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,220
I wonder if I'm allowed
to wear this in here?

505
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,956
I think it would be okay.

506
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,151
Would you like to sit down?

507
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,455
Okay.

508
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,391
Wow!

509
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,231
This place is really nice.

510
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,635
Yeah. Is it?

511
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,900
Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

512
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,204
I like the uniforms better, anyways.

513
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,412
I like yours.

514
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,342
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

515
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:23,987
Really.

516
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,422
It's on your...

517
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,954
Oh... yeah.
That's...

518
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:31,987
That's...

519
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,991
That's one of my pieces of flair.

520
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,158
What's a "piece of flair"?

521
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,225
Oh, it's where, you know,

522
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:42,171
like these suspenders and buttons,
they're all sort of...

523
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,300
We're actually required
to wear

524
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,037
fifteen pieces of flair.

525
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,305
It's really stupid, actually.

526
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,144
- Do you get to pick 'em yourself?
- Yeah, we do.

527
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,275
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

528
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,719
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

529
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:01,156
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

530
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,389
- I don't really like talking about my flair.
- Okay.

531
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,329
So, where do you work, Peter?

532
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,888
Initech.

533
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,764
And... Yeah?
What do you do there?

534
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,636
I sit in a cubicle and I update
bank software for the 2000 switch.

535
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,202
What's that?

536
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,438
Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software

537
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,446
and to save space

538
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,846
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

539
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,283
So like <i>98</i> instead of <i>1998.</i>

540
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,820
So I go through
these thousands of lines of code

541
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,415
and...
It doesn't really matter.

542
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,159
I don't like my job, and...

543
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,759
I don't think I'm gonna go anymore.

544
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,524
- You're just not gonna go?
- Yeah.

545
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,501
Won't you get fired?

546
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,897
I don't know.

547
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,763
But I really don't like it,
and I'm not gonna go.

548
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,638
So you're gonna quit?

549
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,536
Not really.

550
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,976
I'm just gonna stop going.

551
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,850
- When did you decide all that?
- About an hour ago.

552
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,220
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

553
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,553
An hour ago.

554
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,252
So you're getting another job?

555
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,089
I don't think I'd like another job.

556
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,962
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and...

557
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,162
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

558
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,899
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

559
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,834
Well, so what do you want to do?

560
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,009
I want to take you out to dinner.

561
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,274
And then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

562
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,873
Do you ever watch
"Kung Fu"?

563
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,514
I love "Kung Fu."

564
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,850
- Channel 39.
- Totally.

565
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,390
You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

566
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,720
- Okay.
- Great.

567
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,954
Okay. Can we order lunch first?

568
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,586
- Yeah.
- Okay.

569
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,237
Took a stapler off my desk...

570
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:13,153
Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

571
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,725
Hi, Milton.
What's happening?

572
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:18,727
Nothing.

573
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,625
I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

574
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,929
and move your desk again, so...

575
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,562
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

576
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,502
against that wall as possible...

577
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,835
that would be great.

578
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,397
No, because I was...

579
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,876
That way, we'll have some room
for some of these...

580
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,675
boxes and things
we need to put in here.

581
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,113
And...

582
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,549
Oh, there it is.

583
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,282
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

584
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:47,754
Great.

585
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:52,453
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

586
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,998
that would be terrific, okay?

587
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,796
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Goodbye.

588
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:00,564
Okay.

589
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,504
I could set the building on fire.

590
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,712
- Peter.
- Michael.

591
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,974
What the hell's going on?

592
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,175
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

593
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,242
No. I just came to get my address book.
I'm not gonna stay.

594
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,617
I got a phone number
that I don't wanna lose.

595
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,417
What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

596
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,482
You were supposed to come
in on Saturday. What were you doing?

597
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,188
Michael, I did nothing.

598
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,730
I did absolutely nothing...

599
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,733
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

600
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,429
I hope you have a better story
for Lumbergh.

601
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,370
You're supposed to be at
your interview with the consultants.

602
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,304
The who?

603
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,537
The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

604
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,602
Oh, yeah...

605
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,206
Right.

606
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,510
Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

607
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,882
Tell 'em you've been sick.

608
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,114
Oh, no way.
No, I feel great.

609
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,350
It's the best day of my life.

610
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,285
Next batter looks like
a Peter Gibbons.

611
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,126
There you are.
We were just talking about you.

612
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,996
You must be Peter Gibbons.

613
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,264
Terrific.

614
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,735
I'm Bob Slydell.
This is my associate Bob Porter.

615
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,237
Oh, hi, Bob.
Bob.

616
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,275
Grab a seat and join us
for a minute or two.

617
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,038
What we're actually
trying to do here...

618
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,104
is we're trying to get a feel

619
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,581
for how people
spend their day at work.

620
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,810
So if you would,

621
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,821
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

622
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,914
- Yeah.
- Great.

623
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:32,224
Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

624
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,963
I use the side door.
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

625
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:41,004
And after that, I just sort of space out
for about an hour.

626
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,774
- "Space out"?
- Yeah.

627
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,673
I just stare at my desk.

628
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,712
But it looks like I'm working.

629
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,476
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

630
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,177
I'd say in a given week...

631
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:58,814
I probably only do about
fifteen minutes of real, actual work.

632
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,558
Peter, would you be a good sport

633
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,596
and indulge us and just

634
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,687
tell us a little more?

635
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,254
Oh, yeah.

636
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,063
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. Reports.

637
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,965
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

638
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,100
It's that I just don't care.

639
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,974
"Don't care"?

640
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,843
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

641
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,180
Now, if I work my ass off
and Initech ships a few extra units

642
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,082
I don't see another dime.

643
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,348
So where's the motivation?

644
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,422
And here's something else, Bob.

645
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,425
I have <i>8 different bosses right now.

646
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,858
- I beg your pardon?
- Eight bosses.

647
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,259
- Eight?
- Eight, Bob.

648
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,162
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

649
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,258
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

650
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,633
That's my only real motivation,
not to be hassled.

651
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,832
That and the fear of losing my job.
But you know, Bob...

652
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,400
that'll only make someone work
just hard enough not to get fired.

653
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,572
Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

654
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,808
Okay.

655
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,779
What if, and believe me...

656
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,821
this is strictly hypothetical,

657
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,916
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

658
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,688
equity-sharing program?

659
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,022
Would that do anything for you?

660
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:15,065
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

661
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,396
It's been really nice talking
to both of you guys.

662
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,102
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

663
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,365
The pleasure's all
on this side of the table, trust me.

664
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:25,737
Good luck with your layoffs.
I hope your firings go really well.

665
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,243
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot.

666
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,919
So, Peter, what's happening?

667
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,354
Listen...

668
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,700
Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

669
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,597
Yeah.

670
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,162
I'm sorry I was late,
but I was having lunch.

671
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:57,674
- I, uh...
- We need to talk about your flair.

672
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,742
Really?
I have fifteen pieces on.

673
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,244
I also...

674
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,373
Well, fifteen is the minimum.

675
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,643
- Okay?
- Okay.

676
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,378
Now, it's up to you whether or not

677
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,421
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

678
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:16,324
Brian, for example
has 37 pieces of flair on today.

679
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,718
And a terrific smile.

680
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,127
Okay, so you want me
to wear more?

681
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,991
- Joanna...
- Yeah?

682
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,332
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, okay?

683
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:29,965
They come to Chotchkie's
for the atmosphere and the attitude.

684
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,235
That's what the flair's about.

685
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,243
- It's about fun.
- Yeah.

686
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,211
Okay, so more then, yeah?

687
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,178
Look, we want you
to express yourself, okay?

688
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,845
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, okay...

689
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,584
but some people
choose to wear more

690
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,523
and we encourage that, okay?

691
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:54,058
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

692
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,063
Yeah.

693
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,566
Okay, great, great.
That's all I ask.

694
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,493
Okay.

695
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,138
So there's three more people
we can easily lose.

696
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,435
Then there's Tom Synkowski.

697
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,979
He's useless.

698
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,072
Gone.

699
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,747
Sounds good to me.

700
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,186
Here's a peculiar...

701
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,555
- Milton Waddams.
- Who's he?

702
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,988
You know, squirrelly looking guy.
Mumbles a lot.

703
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:21,888
Oh, yeah.

704
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,952
We can't actually find a record of him
being a current employee here.

705
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,827
I looked into it more deeply

706
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,798
and I found that
apparently what happened

707
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,597
is that he was laid off 5 years ago

708
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,228
and no one ever told him about it.

709
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,796
But through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department

710
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,364
he still gets a paycheck.

711
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,967
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

712
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,977
Great.

713
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,606
So, Milton has been let go?

714
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,774
Just a second there, Professor.

715
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,411
We fixed the glitch.

716
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,614
So he won't be receiving
a paycheck anymore.

717
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,157
So it'll just work itself out naturally.

718
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,285
We like to avoid confrontation
whenever possible.

719
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,795
The problem is solved from your end.

720
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,163
I'd like to move us right along
to a Peter Gibbons.

721
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,226
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man

722
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,737
and, boy, that's just a straight shooter

723
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,934
with upper management
written all over him.

724
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,472
Yeah.

725
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,677
I'm going to have to go ahead
and sort of disagree with you there.

726
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,713
Yeah, he's been real flaky lately,

727
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:26,746
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person

728
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,451
that we would want
for upper management.

729
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,188
He's also been having some problems...

730
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,162
with his T.P.S. Reports.

731
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,165
I'll handle this.

732
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,168
We feel...

733
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,771
that the problem isn't with Peter.

734
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,070
It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

735
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,941
- to get him really motivated.
- There it is.

736
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,113
Yeah, well...

737
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,151
I'm just not sure
about that right now.

738
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,449
Yeah, Bill, let me ask you
a real quick question here.

739
00:40:57,521 --> 00:41:00,319
How much time
would you say you spend each week

740
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,792
dealing with these T.P.S. Reports?

741
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,289
Yeah...

742
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,361
Hey, Peter, man!

743
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:20,961
Check out channel nine.
It's the breast exams!

744
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,116
Hi, Peter.

745
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,951
Oh, hi, Dom.

746
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,204
So... Peter...

747
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,007
What's happening?

748
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,743
Now, are you going to go ahead

749
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:38,714
and have those T.P.S. Reports
for us this afternoon?

750
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,147
No.

751
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,909
Ahh... yeah...

752
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,888
So I guess we should
probably go ahead

753
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,857
and have a little talk, hmm?

754
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,918
Not right now, Lumbergh.
I'm kinda busy.

755
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,830
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead

756
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:57,928
and just come back another time.

757
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,301
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

758
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,838
Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

759
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,875
Yeah, they called me at home.

760
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,909
That sounds good, Peter.

761
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,007
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

762
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,382
get this all fixed up for you.

763
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,613
Great.

764
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,357
Hi, Milton.
What's happening?

765
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,592
I... I didn't receive
my paycheck this week.

766
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,569
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

767
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:34,899
I did and they said...

768
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:40,604
Milt, we're gonna go ahead
and move you downstairs into storage "B."

769
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,373
No, I... I...

770
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,405
New people are coming,
and we need the space.

771
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:47,780
But there's no space...

772
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,412
So if you could go ahead
and pack up your stuff

773
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,456
and move it down there...

774
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,719
that would be terrific.

775
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,657
Okay?

776
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,394
Excuse me.

777
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,364
I believe you have my stapler, please.

778
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,933
You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

779
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,939
I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

780
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,533
- Good one.
- That's terrific, Peter.

781
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,773
I'm sure you've... you've heard
some of the rumors

782
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:18,576
circulating around the hallways

783
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:22,745
about how we're gonna be doing a little
housecleaning with some software people.

784
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,983
Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

785
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,047
We'll be getting rid
of these people.

786
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,583
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

787
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,190
Naga...

788
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,495
Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

789
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:41,002
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

790
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,766
You're gonna lay off
Samir and Michael?

791
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,207
We're gonna bring in entry-level graduates,
farm some work out to Singapore.

792
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,312
- That's the usual deal.
- Standard operating procedure.

793
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,176
Do they know this yet?

794
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,409
No. No, of course not.

795
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,647
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

796
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,620
Studies have statistically shown

797
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:02,022
there's less chance of an incident
if you do it at the end of the week.

798
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,459
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position

799
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:10,398
to have as many as four people
working right underneath you.

800
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,560
This is a big promotion.

801
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:13,466
Huge.

802
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,165
So you're going to fire Michael and Samir,
and give me more money?

803
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,506
Wow!

804
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,173
Yeah.

805
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:30,414
That's it. That's exactly what I need.
Give it to me.

806
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,581
Come on, you little fucker.
That's what I need. Let's do that.

807
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,182
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck...

808
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,091
- Michael.
- Hey.

809
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,827
Listen to me.

810
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,357
What are you doing tonight?

811
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,194
Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life,

812
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,139
and maybe that time for you is now,

813
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,802
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

814
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,980
No offense there, Peter.
But speak for yourself there, sport.

815
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,484
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

816
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,746
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever,

817
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,487
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

818
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:13,052
Yeah, and...
Listen.

819
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,327
That virus you're always talking about,

820
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,597
the one that could rip off the company
for a bunch of money.

821
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,399
Yeah, what about it?

822
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,699
How does it work?

823
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,469
It's pretty brilliant.

824
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,407
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction

825
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,037
where interest is computed,
there are thousands a day,

826
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,276
the computer ends up with these fractions
of a cent which it usually rounds off.

827
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,614
What this does is it takes
those little remainders

828
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,813
and puts it into an account.

829
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,379
- This sounds familiar.
- They did it in "Superman III."

830
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,392
- Right.
- An underrated movie, actually.

831
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,861
There were hackers that did it
in the '70s as well.

832
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,325
- So they check for this now.
- No, here's the thing.

833
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,496
Initech's so backed up with all the software
we're updating, they'd never notice.

834
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:58,974
You're right. Even if they wanted to,
they couldn't check all that code.

835
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,977
Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

836
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,976
So, Michael, what's to stop you
from doing this?

837
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,752
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

838
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,115
What if you didn't have a good job?

839
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,415
Cock gobblers!

840
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,356
Samir and I are the best
programmers they got.

841
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,094
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

842
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,692
Actually, I'm being promoted.

843
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,261
- What?!
- I know, Michael.

844
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,838
It's completely unfair.

845
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,406
And I realized something today.

846
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,544
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

847
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,014
It's about all of us together.

848
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:44,982
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

849
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,046
Maybe it was just shock
and it's wearing off now,

850
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,820
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

851
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:53,090
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

852
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,859
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

853
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,232
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles

854
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,168
staring at computer screens
all day.

855
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:04,071
Filling out useless forms
and listening to eight different bosses

856
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,837
drone on about
mission statements.

857
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:11,111
I told those fudge packers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

858
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,308
That is not right, Michael.

859
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,414
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off

860
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:20,388
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

861
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,818
Five years

862
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,683
of your mid-twenties now gone.

863
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:28,720
And you're gonna go in tomorrow,
they're gonna throw you out on the street.

864
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,562
You know why?

865
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:35,037
So that Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

866
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,934
Michael, let's make
that stock go down

867
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,239
and let's take enough money
out of that place

868
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,303
so that we never have to
sit in a cubicle ever again.

869
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,683
Your software works, right?

870
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,584
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

871
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,145
Even if I wanted to,
I wouldn't know how to install it.

872
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,623
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough.

873
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:58,622
Yeah, but Samir does.

874
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,227
- But that's not much money.
- That's the beauty of it.

875
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:06,360
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

876
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,662
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day,

877
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:12,505
you space it out over a couple of years,
that's a few hundred thousand dollars.

878
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,804
It's like "Superman III."

879
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,902
"Superman lll"?

880
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,678
I have to leave now.
I have to get my rsum ready.

881
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,240
Get your rsum ready.
For what?

882
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,946
For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

883
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,717
That's right.
If I'm lucky.

884
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,850
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm tired of being pushed around.

885
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:30,915
Aren't you?

886
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,758
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

887
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,298
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

888
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,391
Come on. Sit down.

889
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,566
Come on.
This isn't Riyadh.

890
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,573
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

891
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,041
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months

892
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,477
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

893
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,210
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

894
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,911
- Really?
- Yes.

895
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,314
Shit!

896
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,049
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

897
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,886
So what do you think?

898
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,483
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

899
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,755
Samir?

900
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,256
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

901
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,461
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

902
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,903
Tomorrow is your last day
at Initech.

903
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,496
You have two options...

904
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,974
unemployment
or early retirement.

905
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,604
What's it gonna be?

906
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,004
- I have a question.
- Yes?

907
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,812
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

908
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,583
Yep, you sure can.

909
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,313
I'll do it.

910
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,293
That's what I'm talkin' about
when I talk about America!

911
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,726
Can we discuss the plan?

912
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,491
Okay, yeah, good, right.

913
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,357
It works like a computer virus.

914
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,960
All we do is load it into the credit union's
mainframe. It'll do the rest.

915
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,369
Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

916
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,306
But before we go any further, all right,

917
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,866
we have to swear to God, Allah,

918
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,436
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

919
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,642
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

920
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:01,843
- Of course.
- Agreed.

921
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,250
Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

922
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,380
- What the fuck is that?
- Don't worry. He's cool.

923
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,857
All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

924
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,793
Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

925
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,091
Thank you, Bob.

926
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,258
We'll get some people under you
right away.

927
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,109
That was easy.

928
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,182
- Yeah, I guess it was.
- What'd you do with the...

929
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,188
Hey, man.

930
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,920
Oh, hey, Drew.

931
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,827
- You guys hear about Tom Smykowski?
- That he got laid off?

932
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,528
No, man, check it out.

933
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,363
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off

934
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,404
he tries to kill himself
by running the car in the garage.

935
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,597
Is he dead?

936
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,969
No, man, check it out.

937
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,305
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

938
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,368
He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

939
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,677
I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

940
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,310
It's jammed.
I couldn't get it into drive.

941
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,116
- I mean, reverse.
- You okay, Tom?

942
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,487
Then as he's lookin' at her

943
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,549
he decides he wants to live.

944
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,622
Yeah, I think I'm okay.

945
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:26,559
Right.

946
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,822
Seems to be working now.

947
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,329
See you later, honey.

948
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,133
Love ya.

949
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:39,134
But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway... Bam!

950
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,837
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

951
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,879
- Is he okay?
- Sort of.

952
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,110
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back.

953
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,344
But he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

954
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:52,182
Like seven figures. He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

955
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:56,248
He's throwing a big party this weekend
to celebrate. We're all invited.

956
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,018
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

957
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:02,155
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

958
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,028
Oh, oh, oh...

959
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,160
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

960
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,398
Yeah. Right.

961
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,300
See you guys there.

962
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,344
Wow, our last day at Initech.

963
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,114
I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

964
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:22,276
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

965
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,887
I stole something.

966
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,444
Yeah. I guess we all did.

967
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,185
No, I stole something else.

968
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,321
What did you steal?

969
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,725
Call it a going-away present.

970
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,263
Who's got my keys?

971
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,695
I'm driving.

972
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,460
Everything is gonna be okay.

973
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,399
All right? Okay?

974
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,061
It's fun, and it's exciting.

975
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,662
I gotta... I gotta go.
All right?

976
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,934
Joanna's coming over.

977
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,171
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

978
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,405
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

979
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,572
Everything will be okay.

980
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,775
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

981
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,545
All right? Good night!

982
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,319
Back up in your ass
with the resurrection.

983
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,017
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

984
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:47,859
Oh, um... I'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

985
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:52,700
I really can't.

986
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,465
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest,

987
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:02,637
it uses all these extra decimal places
that just get rounded off.

988
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,840
So we simplified the whole thing
and we round 'em all down

989
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:09,681
and drop the remainder
into an account that we opened.

990
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,712
So you're stealing?

991
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,120
No, you don't understand.

992
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,957
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

993
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:22,054
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny.

994
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,467
And over time,
they add up to a lot.

995
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:29,269
Okay. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

996
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,636
- Yeah.
- Right.

997
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,799
It's not yours?

998
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,070
Well, it becomes ours.

999
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,406
How is that not stealing?

1000
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,851
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1001
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:45,012
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1002
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,352
You'd take a penny from the tray.

1003
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,789
- From the crippled children?
- No, that's the jar.

1004
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,488
I'm talking about the tray...
the pennies for everybody.

1005
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:54,928
For everybody. Okay.

1006
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,057
Well, those are whole pennies.

1007
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:01,001
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, okay?

1008
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:05,005
But we do it from a much bigger tray
and we do it a couple of million times.

1009
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,564
So what's wrong with that?

1010
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,270
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1011
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:09,504
It's not wrong.

1012
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:10,773
Initech is wrong.

1013
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,510
Initech is an evil corporation, all right?
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1014
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,620
Doesn't it bother you that you have
to put on a bunch of pieces of flair?

1015
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:23,819
Yeah, but I'm not about to go in
and start taking money from the register.

1016
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,656
Well, maybe you should.

1017
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:30,195
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1018
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,526
What?

1019
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,867
Look, we don't...

1020
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,463
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1021
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,134
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1022
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,942
Michael, Samir,
how you doin'

1023
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,141
- Hey, Tom.
- Hello, Tom.

1024
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:50,310
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1025
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:53,116
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1026
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:56,647
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1027
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,718
Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1028
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,661
- This is Joanna.
- Hi.

1029
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,131
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

1030
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:16,211
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1031
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,407
What do you think?
It's a prototype.

1032
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:21,973
Huh. That's...

1033
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,611
That's exactly as you described it.

1034
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,183
Listen, I heard about
your settlement.

1035
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:30,449
Congratulations.

1036
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:31,652
Thanks, Peter.

1037
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,859
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1038
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:39,026
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all,

1039
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,764
and I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1040
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,533
I used to be the same way.

1041
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,439
- Really?
- Sure.

1042
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,339
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1043
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,235
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you,

1044
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,611
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1045
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:54,012
Wow.

1046
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,644
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough,

1047
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,951
good things can happen
in this world.

1048
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,049
I mean, look at me.

1049
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,484
Thanks, Tom.

1050
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,463
Sure.

1051
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,033
Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1052
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,934
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1053
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,170
I have a client in there
right now.

1054
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,837
He says the trick is

1055
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:27,144
kick someone's ass the first day
or become someone's bitch.

1056
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,975
Then everything
will be all right.

1057
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,520
Why do you ask, anyway?

1058
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,851
Oh, no, we just...

1059
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,422
- Hey, Peter.
- Drew.

1060
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:45,694
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1061
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,565
- Yeah.
- Lucky bastard.

1062
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,969
Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1063
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,804
Yep.

1064
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,468
Who's she here with?

1065
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,312
She's with me.

1066
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,809
- Really?
- Yep.

1067
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:04,250
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1068
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:07,956
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1069
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,852
Why's that, Drew?

1070
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:12,789
Are you kidding me?

1071
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,228
She gets around.
All right?

1072
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,330
She does, does she?

1073
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,426
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1074
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:24,772
Like with who?

1075
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,774
Oh, let's see, uh...

1076
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:29,971
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1077
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,378
Let me see, who else?

1078
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,111
Lumbergh?

1079
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,854
What if you get caught?

1080
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:44,154
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1081
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:47,287
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1082
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,059
What?

1083
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:50,462
What are you...

1084
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,125
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1085
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,865
Oh, God. Lumbergh!

1086
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,965
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1087
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:03,136
That was like two years ago.
What? Did you know him?

1088
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,203
Yeah, I know him.
I know him.

1089
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,179
He's my boss.

1090
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,685
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1091
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,811
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1092
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:15,153
He represents all
that is soulless and wrong,

1093
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,956
and you slept with him.

1094
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,427
Hey, that is none
of your business, okay?

1095
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:23,329
I didn't ask you who you slept with
before we were together.

1096
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,593
I don't care.

1097
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,227
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1098
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,998
Listen to you.

1099
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,139
Who do you think you are?
How dare you judge me?

1100
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:36,002
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

1101
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,813
No, you're just this penny-stealing

1102
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,543
wannabe criminal man.

1103
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,312
Yeah, well, that may be.

1104
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,854
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1105
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,219
Okay, I'm done.

1106
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,555
I wanna get out of the car, okay?
Stop.

1107
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,992
Call me when you grow up.

1108
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,963
That's probably never gonna happen,
so don't call me, okay?

1109
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,227
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1110
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:06,905
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1111
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,500
Lumbergh fucked her.

1112
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:10,773
Lumbergh fucked her.

1113
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,780
That is great.

1114
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,917
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1115
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:19,751
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

1116
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,414
Ooh.

1117
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,118
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1118
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,593
That's it. Great.

1119
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,697
Peter, what's happening?

1120
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:33,292
Could you give me those
T.P.S. Reports ASAP, okay?

1121
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,817
- Joanna.
- Yeah.

1122
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,217
We need to talk.

1123
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,587
Do you know what this is about?

1124
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:00,756
My, uh, flair?

1125
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,893
Yeah.

1126
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,765
Or your lack of flair,
because

1127
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,236
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1128
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,603
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1129
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:15,770
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1130
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:20,838
What do I think?
You know what, Stan?

1131
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,376
If you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair

1132
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,785
like your pretty boy
over there, Brian,

1133
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:30,485
why don't you just make the minimum
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1134
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,153
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying

1135
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,459
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1136
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:40,025
Yeah. You know what? I do.
I do want to express myself.

1137
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:43,560
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1138
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:47,107
All right?
There's my flair. Okay?

1139
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:51,476
And this is me
expressing myself. Okay?

1140
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,237
There it is.

1141
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:54,881
I hate this job.

1142
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,545
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1143
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,502
Oh, shit.

1144
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:16,170
- Shit.
- Shit.

1145
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,771
- Shit.
- Son of a bitch.

1146
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,532
- Shit.
- This is a fuck.

1147
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,238
- Son of a bitch!
- What happened?

1148
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,474
You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1149
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,107
Yes, it's your software.

1150
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,345
Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice

1151
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:33,115
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred

1152
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,423
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1153
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,815
Oh, shit.

1154
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:41,727
They probably won't know it's gone
for another three or four days.

1155
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:45,358
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1156
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,925
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1157
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,632
- Technically, it did work.
- No, it didn't!

1158
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,607
It did not work, Michael, okay?

1159
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,234
Okay.

1160
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,474
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1161
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,038
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1162
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:05,143
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1163
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,745
Quit getting pissed at me.

1164
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,722
This was all your idea, asshole.

1165
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:11,955
All right. Okay.

1166
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,519
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1167
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,122
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1168
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,897
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1169
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:25,168
Happy birthday to you

1170
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:30,201
Happy birthday to you

1171
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:35,911
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

1172
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:40,081
Happy birthday to you

1173
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,758
Looks terrific.

1174
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:50,226
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1175
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,635
Oh, that is terrific.

1176
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,001
Just terrific.

1177
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,873
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1178
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:02,205
It's very special.

1179
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,542
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1180
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:07,878
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1181
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,044
But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told...

1182
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:12,614
Just pass.

1183
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:17,892
Okay, here. But this...
If there...

1184
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:22,993
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1185
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:27,025
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1186
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,085
I could set
the building on fire.

1187
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:51,256
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1188
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,660
Hand them a check for the exact
amount they're missing?

1189
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,130
I think they'd figure that out.

1190
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,463
Well, we have to do something.

1191
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,997
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1192
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:05,899
That's a great idea.
How do we do that?

1193
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,603
I don't know.
I don't even know what it means.

1194
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:11,237
I was hoping you knew.
I think coke dealers do it.

1195
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,646
Okay, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1196
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,708
My cousin's a cokehead.

1197
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,659
Fuck. We're in deep shit.

1198
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:28,424
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

1199
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,368
- Milton.
- Yes.

1200
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:36,631
What's happening?

1201
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,196
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1202
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:40,367
But... no.

1203
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,772
Since you're down here,

1204
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,507
it would be really great
if you could just sort of

1205
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,914
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1206
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,452
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheck...

1207
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,852
For now, why don't you go ahead

1208
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,984
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide and crawl down...

1209
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,494
Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1210
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,394
We got a big problem... big.

1211
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:06,491
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

1212
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,066
'Scuse me.

1213
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:14,998
'Scuse me.

1214
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,374
Okay, but that's the last straw.

1215
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,519
Here we go, here we go.

1216
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:28,216
Launder.
"To clean," no. "To wash..."

1217
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,884
Here it is.
"To conceal the source of money

1218
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,896
"as by channeling it through
an intermediary."

1219
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,062
"To conceal..."

1220
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,623
That doesn't really
help us, Michael.

1221
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,294
I can't believe what
a bunch of nerds we are,

1222
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,600
looking up "money laundering"
in a dictionary.

1223
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:48,200
Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, okay?

1224
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,303
I can't believe Joanna slept with Lumbergh.
That's what I can't believe.

1225
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,349
- Yeah. You didn't know that?
- You didn't know that?

1226
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,441
A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1227
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:03,123
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the Initrode guy? The young guy?

1228
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,183
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

1229
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:10,196
Her fucking...
Her children would have hooves.

1230
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:14,501
Ron's not related to Bill,
is he?

1231
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,298
Who's that?

1232
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:21,242
All right, nobody panic.
Probably just Lawrence.

1233
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,013
Good evening, sir. My name is Steve.
I come from a rough area.

1234
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:31,678
I used to be addicted to crack,
but now I'm off and trying to stay clean.

1235
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:34,188
That is why I'm selling
magazine subscriptions.

1236
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:36,247
- No, no.
- Wait a minute.

1237
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,293
You used to be
addicted to crack?

1238
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,085
Yeah. Um...

1239
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,855
Look, I'm very sorry.

1240
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,458
I do not know anything
about any money laundering.

1241
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,970
We're not asking you
about money laundering.

1242
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,270
- All we need is for you to hook us...
- if he doesn't know anybody...

1243
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,105
No. Wait a minute.

1244
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:58,374
Look, you just give us
the name of one drug dealer.

1245
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,608
I could talk to him.
I have good networking skill.

1246
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:01,775
I lied.

1247
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:06,449
That stuff I said about being a crackhead
just helps me sell magazines.

1248
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,152
I'm actually an unemployed
software engineer.

1249
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,893
- You're a software engineer?
- Yep.

1250
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,525
Things, they must be
very rough for you.

1251
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,233
Actually, man,

1252
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:24,864
I make more money selling magazine
subscriptions than I ever did at Initrode.

1253
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,068
At Initrode?

1254
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:30,970
Wait. You're not gonna tell anybody
about all this stuff we told you.

1255
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,844
We know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1256
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,344
Actually, that all depends.

1257
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:47,218
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

1258
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:50,555
We never should have done this.
What were we thinking?

1259
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:52,623
You know what I can't figure out?

1260
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:57,365
How is it that all these stupid Neanderthal
Mafia guys can be so good at crime

1261
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,964
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

1262
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,509
We're new to it, though.

1263
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:04,104
If we had more experience...

1264
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:07,580
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1265
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,215
I think there's enough evidence
all over that building to link us to this.

1266
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,379
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1267
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,047
What we've done is bad enough.

1268
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:18,457
We get caught laundering, we're not
going to white-collar resort prison.

1269
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,462
No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1270
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:24,324
I don't want to go
to any prison.

1271
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,630
Why the hell did I do this?

1272
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,068
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1273
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:32,198
We weren't thinking clearly because
you told us we were losing our jobs.

1274
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,640
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1275
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,008
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

1276
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,907
- I'm going home.
- Me, too.

1277
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,749
You are a very bad person, Peter.

1278
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,639
Lawrence, you awake?

1279
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:10,871
Yeah.

1280
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,773
- You wanna come over?
- No, thanks, man.

1281
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,819
I don't want you
fucking up my life, too.

1282
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:25,884
In light of the senselessness
of these heinous crimes

1283
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,486
that you have committed
against Initech,

1284
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,124
I hereby sentence you,
Michael Bolton

1285
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:36,035
and Samir Naan... Nanadajibad

1286
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:38,368
to a term of no less
than four years

1287
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,035
in a federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1288
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,675
Peter Gibbons,

1289
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,513
you've led a trite
and meaningless life

1290
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:55,155
and you're a very bad person.

1291
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:33,585
Hey.

1292
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,863
You're not working
at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

1293
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,798
No, no. I got fired.

1294
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,093
- What happened?
- I flipped off my boss.

1295
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:46,364
Some customers...

1296
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:49,137
Actually, a line cook but he just happened
to be standing there.

1297
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,180
I might be going away
for a while.

1298
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,041
To jail.

1299
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:59,419
You were right about that computer scam.
That was a bad idea.

1300
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,046
I'm gonna take the blame for it,
I decided.

1301
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,785
I'm on my way now
to return the money

1302
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,853
and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door.

1303
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:11,594
I want to apologize.

1304
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,158
I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

1305
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,967
Lumbergh is not my problem.
It wasn't even the right Lumbergh.

1306
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,976
I don't know why I can't just
go to work and be happy

1307
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:24,478
like I'm supposed to,
like everybody else.

1308
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:27,276
Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

1309
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:30,785
But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

1310
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,717
Yeah. Well.

1311
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,951
I may never be happy at my job,

1312
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:41,485
but I think that if I could be with you
that I could be happy with my life.

1313
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,555
I've been a real asshole.

1314
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,766
But if you'd give it
another shot, I promise...

1315
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,325
Okay, shut up.

1316
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:55,232
Whoa! Hey, what's going on here?

1317
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,809
Get a room, you two!
Ha ha!

1318
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:03,275
I hate that guy.

1319
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,395
Then Mr. Lumbergh
told me to talk to payroll

1320
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,099
and then payroll told me
to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

1321
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,665
And I still haven't received
my paycheck.

1322
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,439
And he took my stapler,
and he never brought it back.

1323
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:08,779
Then they moved my desk to storage room
"B," and there was garbage on it...

1324
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:12,911
Go back down and sit at your desk.
Mr. Lumbergh should be here any minute.

1325
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:16,219
- Mr. Lumbergh...
- Just go sit at your desk.

1326
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,816
Okay, but I'm gonna just...

1327
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,292
I have to take my stapler back

1328
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:32,067
because I told him it's my stapler.

1329
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:38,802
It's my stapler.

1330
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,611
A Swingline, the brand
I've been using for a long time.

1331
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,064
Lawrence, you in there?

1332
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:07,007
Whoa.
Hey, Peter, man.

1333
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,769
Hey.

1334
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,542
So, I might be going away for a while.

1335
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:13,080
Yeah, I know, man.

1336
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,639
It's a bummer.
What can I say?

1337
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,742
Yeah. Yeah.

1338
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:22,953
Well, time to go face the music.

1339
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,617
You take care of yourself
if I don't see you, all right?

1340
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,219
You too, man.
Take her easy, bud.

1341
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,729
All right.

1342
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,000
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

1343
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,571
Watch out for your cornhole, bud.

1344
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,797
Okay, Lawrence.

1345
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,979
Stay clear, now.
Stay clear.

1346
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,220
Holy shit.

1347
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,460
Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at that.

1348
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:14,427
You don't want that, Peter, man.
That's toasted, man.

1349
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:17,437
I think I know someone
who might want this.

1350
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:29,910
Hey, man.

1351
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,949
Wanna go to lunch?

1352
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:37,681
Brought mine in a pail. Plus Joanna's
supposed to come by a little later.

1353
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:41,120
So, how do you like your new job?

1354
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,130
Not too bad, not too bad.

1355
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,756
How's Penetrode?

1356
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,494
Initrode.

1357
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,264
- They're all right.
- It's work.

1358
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,066
Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:52,834
Probably get you a job there.

1360
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,705
No, thanks.

1361
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:56,209
I'm doing good here.

1362
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:01,813
So, uh,
we're gonna be okay, right?

1363
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,275
Yeah.

1364
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:07,121
I think the fire pretty much
took care of everything.

1365
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,783
I wonder if the money burn up.

1366
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,590
- It would be shame.
- Yeah.

1367
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:15,920
So you sure you don't
want us to get you a job?

1368
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:18,898
That's one thing
I'm definitely sure of.

1369
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,964
All right, chief.

1370
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,739
- You guys take care.
- All right.

1371
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:28,274
Stay in touch, man.

1372
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,208
Okay. Will do.

1373
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:35,876
This isn't so bad, huh?

1374
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:42,012
Making bucks, getting exercise,
working outside.

1375
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,889
Fuckin' "A."

1376
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:48,257
Fuckin' "A."

1377
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,911
Excuse me.
Excuse me, seor.

1378
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:10,841
May I speak to you, please?

1379
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,547
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a pia colada.

1380
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,716
And I said no salt, no salt
for the margarita, but it had salt on it.

1381
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,386
Lo siento mucho, seor.
Pinche gringo.

1382
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:24,091
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1383
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,597
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1384
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:27,635
Sir?

1385
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,771
I'll take my traveler's checks
to a competing resort.

1386
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:36,607
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism

1387
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,908
and I could have this place
condemned.

1388
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:43,780
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1389
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,082
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1390
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,668
Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1391
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:22,179
Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1392
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:23,880
You big fag.

1393
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:50,014
I'm working at Hooters now,
you know, and it's very cool.
